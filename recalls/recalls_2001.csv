The affected vehicles are equipped with either a 2.3L or 3.0L engine and have had their CD4E transmission replaced with remanufactured one that was rebuilt between June 11, 2015 through July 15, 2015.  These service repair part transmissions have a shift lever bolt that may not be properly tightened.  As a result, the shift control lever could disengage from the transmission without warning.","If the shift lever disengages from the transmission, a driver may be unable to shift gear positions and the indicated shift position may not represent the gear position the vehicle is in.  Should a disengagement occur while the vehicle is being driven, when the driver goes to stop and park the vehicle, the gear selection indicator may show that the transmission is in the ""PARK"" position, but the vehicle transmission may not actually be in the ""PARK"" gear position.  If the vehicle is not in the ""PARK"" position there is a risk the vehicle will roll away as the driver and other occupants exit the vehicle or anytime thereafter.  A vehicle rollaway increases the risk of injury to exiting occupants and bystanders.","Ford will notify owners, and dealers will inspect the transmissions and either tighten the manual shift lever bolt or replace the manual shift lever assembly.

If the plate is insufficiently coated and the vehicle is operated in cold climate regions where road salts are frequently used, road spray can reach the carrier assembly and corrode the lift plate.","Corrosion of the plate could cause it to break, which could result in detachment of the spare tire from the vehicle.
