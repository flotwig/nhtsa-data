These service repair part transmissions have a shift lever bolt that may not be properly tightened.  As a result, the shift control lever could disengage from the transmission without warning.","If the shift lever disengages from the transmission, a driver may be unable to shift gear positions and the indicated shift position may not represent the gear position the vehicle is in.  Should a disengagement occur while the vehicle is being driven, when the driver goes to stop and park the vehicle, the gear selection indicator may show that the transmission is in the ""PARK"" position, but the vehicle transmission may not actually be in the ""PARK"" gear position.  If the vehicle is not in the ""PARK"" position there is a risk the vehicle will roll away as the driver and other occupants exit the vehicle or anytime thereafter.  A vehicle rollaway increases the risk of injury to exiting occupants and bystanders.","Ford will notify owners, and dealers will inspect the transmissions and either tighten the manual shift lever bolt or replace the manual shift lever assembly.

Until this recall is performed, customers should remove all items from their key rings, leaving only the ignition key.  The key fob (if applicable), should also be removed from the key ring.
General Motors LLC (GM) notified the agency on February 10, 2014 that they are recalling 619,122 model year 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalt, and 2007 Pontiac G5 vehicles.  On February 25, 2014, GM increased the recall to include an additional 748,024 model year 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHR and Pontiac Solstice vehicles and 2003-2007 Saturn Ion vehicles and 2007 Saturn Sky vehicles.   In these models, the weight on the key ring and/or road conditions or some other jarring event may cause the ignition switch to move out of the run position, turning off the engine.
On March 27, 2014, GM notified the agency that the defective ignition switches may have been used as service replacement parts on other vehicles, and as a result GM will be recalling certain model year 2008-2010 Chevrolet Cobalt, Saturn Sky, and Pontiac G5 and Solstice, and 2008-2011 Chevrolet HHR vehicles.  The part numbers for the service parts are 10392423 (a/k/a ACDelco D1461F), 10392737, 15857948, 15854953, 15896640, and 25846762.  This expansion represents an additional 823,788 vehicles.","If the key is not in the run position, the air bags may not deploy if the vehicle is involved in a crash, increasing the risk of injury.","GM will notify owners, and dealers will replace the ignition switch, free of charge.  An interim notification was issued to owners of 2007 and earlier models on March 10, 2014, informing them of the safety defect.  Owners of 2008 and later vehicles will be mailed an interim letter on April 21, 2014.  All affected owners will receive another letter once parts are available.  The recall began on April 18, 2014.  Owners may contact Chevrolet at 1-800-222-1020, Pontiac at 1-800-762-2737 or Saturn at 1-800-553-6000.  GM's number for the initial recall is 13454 and 14063 for the expansion.  GMs recall number for the vehicles that may have received the replacement parts is 14092.  Note:  Until the recall repairs have been performed, it is very important that customers remove all items from their key rings, leaving only the vehicle key.  The key fob (if applicable), should also be removed from the key ring.
