In these models, the weight on the key ring and/or road conditions or some other jarring event may cause the ignition switch to move out of the run position, turning off the engine.
On March 27, 2014, GM notified the agency that the defective ignition switches may have been used as service replacement parts on other vehicles, and as a result GM will be recalling certain model year 2008-2010 Chevrolet Cobalt, Saturn Sky, and Pontiac G5 and Solstice, and 2008-2011 Chevrolet HHR vehicles.  The part numbers for the service parts are 10392423 (a/k/a ACDelco D1461F), 10392737, 15857948, 15854953, 15896640, and 25846762.  This expansion represents an additional 823,788 vehicles.","If the key is not in the run position, the air bags may not deploy if the vehicle is involved in a crash, increasing the risk of injury.","GM will notify owners, and dealers will replace the ignition switch, free of charge.  An interim notification was issued to owners of 2007 and earlier models on March 10, 2014, informing them of the safety defect.  Owners of 2008 and later vehicles will be mailed an interim letter on April 21, 2014.  All affected owners will receive another letter once parts are available.  The recall began on April 18, 2014.  Owners may contact Chevrolet at 1-800-222-1020, Pontiac at 1-800-762-2737 or Saturn at 1-800-553-6000.  GM's number for the initial recall is 13454 and 14063 for the expansion.  GMs recall number for the vehicles that may have received the replacement parts is 14092.  Note:  Until the recall repairs have been performed, it is very important that customers remove all items from their key rings, leaving only the vehicle key.  The key fob (if applicable), should also be removed from the key ring.  Always wear your seatbelt.","Owners may also contact the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Vehicle Safety Hotline at 1-888-327-4236 (TTY 1-800-424-9153), or go to www.safercar.gov.","2007","SATURN","SKY"
