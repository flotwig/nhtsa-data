These service repair part transmissions have a shift lever bolt that may not be properly tightened.  As a result, the shift control lever could disengage from the transmission without warning.","If the shift lever disengages from the transmission, a driver may be unable to shift gear positions and the indicated shift position may not represent the gear position the vehicle is in.

If the vehicle is not in the ""PARK"" position there is a risk the vehicle will roll away as the driver and other occupants exit the vehicle or anytime thereafter.

Inadequate clearance between the engine cover and the speed control cable connector could result in a stuck throttle when the accelerator pedal is fully or almost-fully depressed.  This risk exists regardless of whether or not speed control (cruise control) is used.","A stuck throttle may result in very high vehicle speeds and make it difficult to stop or slow the vehicle, which could cause a crash, serious injury or death.","Ford will notify owners, and dealers will repair the vehicles by increasing the engine cover clearance, free of charge.  The safety recall began August 3, 2012.  Remedy parts are expected to be available in mid-August 2012.  Until then dealers will disconnect the speed control cable as an interim remedy, if parts are not available at the time of an owner's service appointment.
