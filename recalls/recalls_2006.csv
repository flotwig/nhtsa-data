Until this recall is performed, customers should remove all items from their key rings, leaving only the ignition key.  The key fob (if applicable), should also be removed from the key ring.
General Motors LLC (GM) notified the agency on February 10, 2014 that they are recalling 619,122 model year 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalt, and 2007 Pontiac G5 vehicles.  On February 25, 2014, GM increased the recall to include an additional 748,024 model year 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHR and Pontiac Solstice vehicles and 2003-2007 Saturn Ion vehicles and 2007 Saturn Sky vehicles.   In these models, the weight on the key ring and/or road conditions or some other jarring event may cause the ignition switch to move out of the run position, turning off the engine.
On March 27, 2014, GM notified the agency that the defective ignition switches may have been used as service replacement parts on other vehicles, and as a result GM will be recalling certain model year 2008-2010 Chevrolet Cobalt, Saturn Sky, and Pontiac G5 and Solstice, and 2008-2011 Chevrolet HHR vehicles.  The part numbers for the service parts are 10392423 (a/k/a ACDelco D1461F), 10392737, 15857948, 15854953, 15896640, and 25846762.  This expansion represents an additional 823,788 vehicles.","If the key is not in the run position, the air bags may not deploy if the vehicle is involved in a crash, increasing the risk of injury.","GM will notify owners, and dealers will replace the ignition switch, free of charge.  An interim notification was issued to owners of 2007 and earlier models on March 10, 2014, informing them of the safety defect.  Owners of 2008 and later vehicles will be mailed an interim letter on April 21, 2014.  All affected owners will receive another letter once parts are available.  The recall began on April 18, 2014.  Owners may contact Chevrolet at 1-800-222-1020, Pontiac at 1-800-762-2737 or Saturn at 1-800-553-6000.  GM's number for the initial recall is 13454 and 14063 for the expansion.  GMs recall number for the vehicles that may have received the replacement parts is 14092.  Note:  Until the recall repairs have been performed, it is very important that customers remove all items from their key rings, leaving only the vehicle key.  The key fob (if applicable), should also be removed from the key ring.  Always wear your seatbelt.","Owners may also contact the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Vehicle Safety Hotline at 1-888-327-4236 (TTY 1-800-424-9153), or go to www.safercar.gov.","2006","CHEVROLET","COBALT"

The total number of vehicles being recalled is now 1,712,336.  In the affected vehicles, the stop lamp switch may malfunction.  A malfunctioning stop lamp switch may cause the brake lights to not illuminate when the brake pedal is depressed or may cause an inability to deactivate the cruise control by depressing the brake pedal.  Additionally, a malfunctioning stop lamp switch may also result in intermittent operation of the push-button start feature, affect the operation of the brake transmission shift interlock feature, preventing the shifter from being moved out of the PARK position and cause the Electronic Stability Control (ESC) malfunction light to illuminate.","Failure to illuminate the stop lamps during braking or inability to disengage the cruise control could increase the risk of a crash.  Additionally, when the ignition is in the 'ON' position, the transmission shifter may be able to be moved out of Park without first applying the brake.

Originally, in April 2013, Hyundai recalled 1,059,824 model year 2007-2009 Accent and Tucson, model year 2007-2010 Elantra, model year 2007-2011 Santa Fe, model year 2008-2009 Veracruz, model year 2010-2011 Genesis Coupe, and model year 2011 Sonata vehicles.   In September 2013, Hyundai informed the agency that it was adding more vehicles to this campaign, representing an additional 652,512 units.  The total number of vehicles being recalled is now 1,712,336.  In the affected vehicles, the stop lamp switch may malfunction.  A malfunctioning stop lamp switch may cause the brake lights to not illuminate when the brake pedal is depressed or may cause an inability to deactivate the cruise control by depressing the brake pedal.  Additionally, a malfunctioning stop lamp switch may also result in intermittent operation of the push-button start feature, affect the operation of the brake transmission shift interlock feature, preventing the shifter from being moved out of the PARK position and cause the Electronic Stability Control (ESC) malfunction light to illuminate.","Failure to illuminate the stop lamps during braking or inability to disengage the cruise control could increase the risk of a crash.  Additionally, when the ignition is in the 'ON' position, the transmission shifter may be able to be moved out of Park without first applying the brake.
