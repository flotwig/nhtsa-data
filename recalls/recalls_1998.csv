These vehicles were equipped with Non-Azide Driver air bag Inflators (NADI) and do not contain phase stabilized ammonium nitrate (PSAN) propellant.  Due to a manufacturing issue, the NADI inflators may absorb moisture, causing the inflators to rupture or the air bag cushion to underinflate.","In the event of a crash necessitating air bag deployment, an inflator rupture may result in metal fragments striking the driver or other occupants.  An underinflated air bag cushion may not properly protect the occupant.  These scenarios increase the risk of serious injury or death.","Honda will notify owners, and dealers will inspect the driver frontal air bag inflator, and replace it if necessary, with an inflator of a different design, free of charge.  The recall began October 1, 2020.  Owners may contact American Honda's Customer Support & Campaign Center at 1-888-234-2138 or Isuzu customer service at 1-800-255-6727.","Owners may also contact the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Vehicle Safety Hotline at 1-888-327-4236 (TTY 1-800-424-9153), or go to www.safercar.gov.","1998","ACURA","CL"

These vehicles were equipped with Non-Azide Driver air bag Inflators (NADI) and do not contain phase stabilized ammonium nitrate (PSAN) propellant.

These vehicles were equipped with Non-Azide Driver air bag Inflators (NADI) and do not contain phase stabilized ammonium nitrate (PSAN) propellant.

The affected vehicles were previously repaired under recalls 08V-118, 09V-116, and 15V-201 to address the possibility that engine oil may drip onto the hot exhaust manifold.","Engine oil that drips onto the hot surface of the exhaust manifold may result in a fire.","The remedy applied under recalls 08V-118, 09V-116, and 15V-201 did not adequately remove the safety risk.

Vehicles that are covered by recalls 08V-118, 09V-116, or 15V-201 that have not yet received the original remedy will instead receive the improved remedy under the original recall number.

These vehicles were equipped with Non-Azide Driver air bag Inflators (NADI) and do not contain phase stabilized ammonium nitrate (PSAN) propellant.  Due to a manufacturing issue, the NADI inflators may absorb moisture, causing the inflators to rupture or the air bag cushion to underinflate.","In the event of a crash necessitating air bag deployment, an inflator rupture may result in metal fragments striking the driver or other occupants.  An underinflated air bag may not properly protect the occupant, and increases the risk of serious injury or death.","Toyota will notify owners, and owners will have the option to self-inspect, or have a dealer inspect the steering wheel on their vehicle to determine if their vehicle may be equipped with an affected inflator.  Potentially affected steering wheel serial numbers will be inspected by a dealer.  Based on the inspection, dealers will replace the front driver air bag inflator with an alternate one, as necessary.  These repairs will be performed free of charge.  The recall began August 28, 2020.  Owners may contact Toyota customer service at 1-888-270-9371.  Toyota's numbers for this recall is 20TB01 and 20TA01.","Owners may also contact the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Vehicle Safety Hotline at 1-888-327-4236 (TTY 1-800-424-9153), or go to www.safercar.gov.","1998","TOYOTA","SUPRA"
