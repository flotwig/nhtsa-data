These vehicles were equipped with Non-Azide Driver air bag Inflators (NADI) and do not contain phase stabilized ammonium nitrate (PSAN) propellant.  Due to a manufacturing issue, the NADI inflators may absorb moisture, causing the inflators to rupture or the air bag cushion to underinflate.","In the event of a crash necessitating air bag deployment, an inflator rupture may result in metal fragments striking the driver or other occupants.  An underinflated air bag may not properly protect the occupant, and increases the risk of serious injury or death.","Toyota will notify owners, and owners will have the option to self-inspect, or have a dealer inspect the steering wheel on their vehicle to determine if their vehicle may be equipped with an affected inflator.  Potentially affected steering wheel serial numbers will be inspected by a dealer.  Based on the inspection, dealers will replace the front driver air bag inflator with an alternate one, as necessary.  These repairs will be performed free of charge.  The recall began August 28, 2020.  Owners may contact Toyota customer service at 1-888-270-9371.
