IN ORDER TO FILL OUT THIS REPORT, I HAD TO SIDESTEP YOUR TIRE INFORMATION AND KIND OF VEHICLE . 2 OF THE TIRES HAD BAD SEAL BEADS BEFORE MOUNTING. AFTER MOUNTING, ALL TIRES WERE CLOSELY MONITORED, BUT SHOWED INCREASING AIR BUBBLES AND SEPARATIONS IN THE SIDEWALLS AS THE CAR WAS DRIVEN.  I WASN'T TOLD AT TIME OF PURCHASE THAT THESE TIRES WERE DEFECTIVE. THE TIRES WERE NOT MARKED""BLEMS"". WITH LESS THAN 500 MILES, I HAD THE TIRES INSPECTED AGAIN BY THE MAN WHO MOUNTED THEM. WE AGREED THAT WE NOW HAD ENOUGH PROOF THAT I SHOULD STOP DRIVING THE CAR BEFORE I HAD AN ACCIDENT. *TR",VOLKSWAGEN,VOLKSWAGEN

WE ALSO HAD 5 NEW BF GOODRICH TIRES. BEFORE THIS WAS TAKEN ON THE ROAD, A PROFESSIONAL MECHANIC CAME AND ADJUSTED THE THRANSMISION LINKAGE AND TOOK IT ON A TEST DRIVE. THE NEXT STEP WAS TO BRING IT TO THELOCAL FIRESTONE DEALER AND THEY ALLIGNED THE FRONT END AND CHECKED ALL THE SUSPENSION. WHEN WE HAD 800 MILES ON IT AND NO HINT OF TROUBLE WITH DRIVE TRAIN WE TOOK OUR 9 YEAR OLD GRANDSON ON A TRIP TO MOUNT RUSHMORE AND THE BLACK HILLS. THIS VEHICLE DID HAVE A NATIONAL HOT ROD ASSOCIATION 23POINT SAFETY CHECK, WHICH IT OF COURSE PASSED WITH FLYING COLORS----INCLUDING SEATBELTS. WITH 1400 MILES ON VEHICLE, WE HAD A TERRIBLE VIBRATION IN FRONT END--I PULLED OVER AND LOOKED @ SUSPENSION WHICH LOOKED FINE--WE SLOWLY DROVE TO THE NEAREST TOWN--WALL SD, THERE A TIRE SHOP SAID THEY WOULD TAKE A LOOK- I STARTED DRIVING INTO THE SHOP AND HE SAW THE BULGE IN THE RIGHT FRONT TIRE, HE SAID THE STEEL BELT BROKE AND I SHOULD JUST TAKE IT TO A BF GOODRICH DEALER AND THEY WOULD TAKE CARE OF IT AS THE TIRE WAS OBVIOUSLY BAD FROM FACTORY. HE PUT OUR SPARE ON AND WE WERE ON OUR WAY.LESS THAN 600 MILES LATER WE WERE ON THE INTERSTATE DOING 75 WHEN THE BACK LEFT TIRE LOST 80% OF ITS TREAD,BUT IT STILL HELD AIR SO WE DROVE 15 MILES TO THE NEXT TOWN ON THE SHOULDER OF THE INTERSTATE DOING ABOUT 12MPH,WITH THE FLASHERS ON. WHEN THE TIRE LOST ITS TREAD IT HIT THE BACK FENDER PUSING IT IN ABOUT 6"".THERE IN MURDO AT THE ONLY SHOP IN TOWN THAT HAD ANY CAR TIRES WE PUT ON 2 NEW TIRE ON THE BACK-THEY WERE A COUPLE SIZES SMALLER, BUT THAT WAS ALL THEY HAD. WE THEN DROVE ABOUT 145 MILES TO MITCHELL SD AND SPENT THE NIGHT-BEFORE WE CHECKED OUT OF THE HOTEL, I CHECKED ALL THE TIRES AND THE FRONT LEFT HAD A BULGE SO I WAS GOING TO PUT THE SPARE ON AND IT TOO HAD A BULGE SO WE BOUGHT 2 MORE NEW TIRES @ MITCHELL.  *TR",VOLKSWAGEN,VOLKSWAGEN
