It showed 2 outstanding recalls for left and right seat belt retractor failures.  I called 3 local Chevy dealers to set up a repair, and no one wanted to touch the vehicle.  They all said to call GM.  For the next few months I went back and forth with GM to set up repairs.  They set up a reference number-9-6244952226. In a nutshell, they finally advised that they only repair recalls for a certain amount of time and I was out of luck because they no longer had the equipment in stock for repairs.  I questioned why not just remove the 1988 seat belt retractors and retrofit retractors from a later model.  They did not see my reasoning.  I did not pursue this in 2021 due to covid, but I am driving the vehicle now and would like to make it safe.  Can you help me? The recall numbers are N910058 and N910059.

SO FAR THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY INJURY OR DEATHS REPORTED HERE BUT I SEE HOW ONE COULD BE STRANDED IN AN SUV IN A VERY BAD SITUATION! IN MY CASE THE DEALER FOUND THE PROBLEM AND REPLACED THE TRANS BEFORE I GOT BROKE DOWN ON THE BEACH SOMEWHERE WITH AN INCOMMING TIDE! GM SEEMS TO THINK THAT IT IS REASONABLE TO REPLACE THIS TRANSMISSION 4 TIMES ON MY TRUCK BUT, LIKE THE OTHERS ON THE WEBSITE I THINK THEY SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE AND IF NOTHING ELSE PROVIDE AN EXTENDED WARANTEE ON TRANSMISSIONS TO THOSE OF US DUM ENOUGH TO KEEP BUYING THEIR PRODUCTS. ALL OF THESE FOLKS ON THE WEBSITE CAN'T BE WRONG. GM HAS A PROBLEM AND IT WILL RESULT IN AN INJURY OR DEATH BEFORE THEY WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND DO THE RIGHT THING!

I TOLD HIM I WOULD NOT TAKE IT THERE; HE HAD TO DO IT.  HE DID SO AND HIS MECHANIC REPAIRED IT IN TWO DAYS.  I PICKED IT UP ON THE 19TH.  ON THE 20TH, THE ALTERNATOR WENT OUT.  I CALLED HIM AGAIN.

IF I FIND OUT THAT GOODYEAR KNEW OF THE DEFECT IN THESE TIRES BEFORE JUNE, 2001, AND DID NOT WARN ME, I AM GOING TO BE UPSET, BECAUSE IT ALLMOST KILLED ME.

THIS BLOWOUT WAS ON THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE, AND WAS UNEVENTFUL, BUT SINCE IT WAS ONE OF THE SET OF FOUR THAT I HAD PURCHASED NEW FROM THE LOCAL GOODYEAR STORE, I BECAME SUSPICIOUS.  I BECAME MORE SUSPICIOUS WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT THE TIRE WAS THE SAME NUMBER AS THE OTHER ONE THAT BLEWOUT A YEAR BEFORE.  THIS BLOWOUT LEFT ME OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE IN NEW MEXICO WITHOUT A SPARE.  I STILL HAVE THIS TIRE.  THE OTHER TWO TIRES OF THE SET OF FOUR TIRES HAD THE # NPC8 JPHR 309.

YOUR RECALL CAMPAIGN 96V071000 MAY BE MISSING A MECHANISM FOR CATASTROPHIC BRAKE FAILURE ON THE FORD TRUCK. MY 1988 F250HD SUPERCAB 4X4 HAS EXHIBITED THREE DIFFERENT MECHANISMS FOR BRAKE LOSS. WHEN <1 YEAR OLD WITH <10K MILES ON IT, WE DROVE A DIRT ROAD WHICH AFTER LEVEL TRAVEL (I.E. ABSOLUTELY NOT OVERHEATED FROM MOUNTAIN DRIVING) WINDS DOWN A CLIFF. THE HAIRPIN SWITCH-BACKS REQUIRED ME TO JOCKEY THE LONG SUPERCAB AROUND THE CORNERS WITH REPEATED BRAKE APPLICATION, BUT ALL AT NEAR 0 MPH AND OVER ABOUT 15 MINUTES TIME. AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CLIFF @<10MPH TOWARD A CREEK I ATTEMPTED TO SLOW DOWN. THE BRAKE PEDAL STOPPED AT THE NORMAL POINT BUT THERE WAS NO BRAKING FORCE. THERE WAS A DOWNWARD SLOPE (LESS THAN 10 DEGREES PITCH). PUMPING THE BRAKES DID NOT HELP. I PRESSED THE BRAKE PEDAL WITH MAXIMUM FORCE WITH BOTH LEGS! AND COULD NOT EVEN SLOW THE VEHICLE! (THE VEHICLE HAD A FIBERGLASS TOPPER INSTALLED SO PAYLOAD EST. ~1,500 LBS). SUBSTANTIAL FORCE WAS APPLIED TO THE BRAKE PEDAL! IF WE HAD BEEN KILLED, THE BRAKES WOULD HAVE CHECKED OUT FINE AFTER THE FACT. I BELIEVE THERE PROBABLY HAVE BEEN OTHER INSTANCES THAT HAVE GONE UNREPORTED OR WHICH HAVE RESULTED IN ACCIDENTS AND/OR DEATHS IN WHICH THIS BRAKING PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED. BELTS AND BRAKE FLUID WERE NOMINAL. THE FRONT DISKS AND REAR AXLES WERE NOT HOT TO THE TOUCH. MY WIFE APPLIED THE BRAKES WHILE I INSPECTED THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT AND NO ABNORMAL SOUNDS OR OTHER CUES TO THE CAUSE COULD BE OBSERVED. I TURNED THE VEHICLE OFF ANDRESTARTED A COUPLE OF TIMES WITH NO EFFECT. THIS PERSISTED >45 MINUTES WHILE WE TRIED TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. ON THE UPPER SIDE OF THE BRAKE BOOST CANISTER THERE IS A GROMMET/FITTING FOR THE VACUUM HOSE ATTACHMENT.

SUBSEQUENT INSPECTION REVEALED THAT THE HOLLOW PLASTIC HEAD PIECE ON THE ACTUATOR CABLE HAD BROKEN AND THE CONTROL CABLE WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO PULL ON THE THROTTLE.  THE STEEL CABLE IS TERMINATED A COUPLE OF INCHES BACK OF THE THROTTLE ARM AND SLIDES FREELY INSIDE THE PLASTIC HEAD PIECE WHICH IS ATTACHED THE THROTTLE ARM ITSELF.

NO AMOUNT OF  MANIPULATION OF THE PEDDLE COULD GET PROBLEM TO CLEAR SO I HAD TO KILL THE IGNITION AND COAST TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  I GOT OUT AND INSPECTED THE LINKAGE AND DISCOVERED THAT THE END OF THE CRUISE CONTROL CABLE HAD SLID PAST THE END OF THE PLASTIC HEAD PIECE AND HAD JAMMED THE THROTTLE WIDE OPEN.

I FOUND THAT THE OLD SWITCH AS WELL AS THE NEW FAULTY SWITCH, BECAME SEPARATED. THE END CRIMPS SLOWLY BEND OPEN AND THE TOP OF THE SWITCH PUSHES AWAY FROM THE BASE.

THE BEARING GETS WORN TO THE POINT WHERE THE MAGNETS ON THE INSIDE OF THE CLUTCH BASKET AT THE END OF THE MAINSHAFT COME IN CONTACT WITH THE STATOR MOUNTED OVER THE TRANSMISSION DOOR.  THE RESULT IS THAT THE CLUTCH BASKET MAGNETS BREAK UP AND THE GEARS IN THE TRANSMISSION START TO SHATTER.  THIS CAN CAUSE THE TRANSMISSION TO LOCK UP, CAUSING A LOSS OF POWER AND CONTROL OF THE MOTORCYCLE. ANOTHER RESULT IS THAT, IF THE MAGNETS INSIDE THE CLUTCH BASKET DON'T CAUSE THE TRANSMISSION TO SHATTER, THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM, BECAUSE THE MAGNETS ARE BROKEN, CEASES TO PUT OUT ENOUGH DC POWER TO BOTH RUN THE MOTORCYCLE AND RECHARGE THE BATTERY.  THIS WILL CAUSE THE MOTORCYCLE TO NOT HAVE ENOUGH CHARGE IN THE BATTERY TO RESTART THE MOTORCYCLE AFTER YOU PARK IT, LEAVING YOU STRANDED.  THIS HAS HAPPENED TO MY MOTORCYCLE THREE (3) TIMES IN LESS THAN 30,000 MILES.  HARLEY DAVIDSON REDESIGNED THE CHARGING SYSTEM IN 1992 AND MOVED THE CHARGING SYSTEM TO THE FRONT CRANKSHAFT, THUS ELIMINATING THE PROBLEM.  HOWEVER, THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 80,000 TO 100,000 OF THIS MODEL OF 4-SPEED EVOLUTION SPORTSTER STILL ON THE ROAD.

BOTH REAR MOUNTS FAILED AND IN THE PROCESS DISCONNECTED THE STEERING LINKAGE AT THE SLIP JOINT UNDER THE DASH WHICH ALLOWS FOR THE TILT STEERING.  THIS STEERING JOINT COMPLETLY SEPARATED BECAUSE OF THE DISTANCE ALLOWED TO TRAVEL FROM THE ASSEMBLY FALLING.  ALL STEERING WAS LOSS AND THERE WAS NO CONTROL OF THE VEHICAL AVAILABLE.  THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY RISK!!!!  PEOPLE WILL BE HURT IF NOT KILLED BECAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM ESPECIALLY IF INCOUNTERED AT HIGH SPEEDS OR TRAFFIC.  LINCOLN HAS BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE PROBLEM AND I HAVE FOUND PREVIOUS RECALLS FOR THIS PROBLEM BUT ONLY IN HIGH ERROSION STATES, MI, CT IL ECT.....  I BELIEVE THIS PROBLEM IS LARGER THAN ONCE THOUGHT DUE TO THE WAY THE CAR WAS MANUFACTURED.  THE WASHERS USED ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO RUST BECAUSE OF THE CONTOURS AND GAUGE OF THE METAL USED.  IT HAS NOTHING TO DUE TO THE AREA THAT A CAR HAS BEEN DRIVEN.  THE FACT THERE ARE NO SAFETY CATCHES UNDER THE CAR IS SIMPLY WRONG.  UNDER THE PREVIOUS RECALLS IT IS STATED THAT THE STEERING MAY BECOME HARD TO CONTROL WHEN THE MOUNTS FAIL.  THE STEERING IS NOT HARD TO CONTROL BUT IS IMPOSSIBLE,  IT IS NO LONGER CONNECTED.  THE DIRECTION YOU ARE TRAVELING AT THE TIME OF FAILURE IS THE DIRECTION YOU CONTINUE TO FOLLOW UNTIL STOPPED OR REDIRECTED BY THE FORCES OF NATURE.

THE FIRST ONE OCCURRED APPROXIMATELY FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN THE ENGINE CAUGHT FIRE ON MY 1986 RX7, LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO PUT THE FIRE OUT BEFORE TOTAL DEVASTATION. THE RESULT OF THE FIRE WAS ABOUT $1500.00 WORTH OF REPAIRS. THE REPAIR SHOP SAID THAT THE FIRE WAS THE RESULT OF A FUEL LEAK FROM THE PULSATION DAMPER. I NOW OWN A 1988 RX7 CONVERTIBLE AND ALL OF THE SUDDEN I BEGAN TO SMELL FUEL INSIDE THE CAR REALLY STRONG, SO STRONG IN FACT THAT I THOUGHT THAT THE FUEL TANK MUST BE LEAKING. I IMMEDIATELY PARKED THE CAR AND STARTED TO GIVE IT THE ONCE OVER NEVER THINKING THAT WITH THE SMELL BEING SOO STRONG THAT IT COULD BE COMING FROM THE PULSATION DAMPER. I CHECKED THE GAS TANK AND EVERY HOSE ON IT, NOT A DROP OF FUEL, AS A LAST RESORT I FIGURED I BETTER CHECK THE PULSATION DAMPER AND SURE ENOUGH FUEL WAS POURING OUT OF IT. I THINK THAT IF MY CAR HAD NOT BEEN A CONVERTIBLE I WOULD HAVE NOT NOTICED IT UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE AND HAD ANOTHER FIRE. NOW EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS NO FIRE IT IS STILL GOING TO COST AROUND $500.00 TO REPAIR BECAUSE THE PART IS LOCATED UNDERNEATH THE FUEL INJECTION ASSEMBLY WHICH HAS TO BE COMPLETELY REMOVED IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE PULSATION DAMPER. I BELIEVE MAZDA SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPAIR, THEY KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS/DEADLY SITUATION AND WILL DO NOTHING ABOUT IT. *TR",MAZDA,RX7

IT WAS AN EXTREMELY FOGGY EVENING.  I RECEIVED A CALL AT THE HOUSE AT 6:50 PM THAT MY WIFE HAD BEEN IN A CAR ACCIDENT AND THAT I NEEDED TO COME TO THE SITE.  MY CAR WAS IN MINT CONDITION INSIDE AND OUT BEFORE THE ACCIDENT.  WHEN I SAW THE CAR, IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE!!  MY WIFE, WITNESSES, LAW ENFORCEMENT AND GOODYEAR TIRE CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS THE MERCURY COUGAR?S COMPUTER THAT CAUSED THE ENGINE TO GO FULL-THROTTLE.  DIANE, MY WIFE AND PASSENGER TESTIFIED THAT WHEN THE ENGINE SURGED, SHE PUT BOTH FEET ON THE BRAKE PEDAL TO STOP THE CAR.  AFTER NO AVAIL, SHE APPLIED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE.  THIS CAUSED THE VEHICLE TO SPIN INTO A HEAVILY TRAVELED INTERSECTION.  AS THE VEHICLE SPUN, MY WIFE TRIED TO PUT THE VEHICLE INTO ?PARK?.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE VEHICLE CHANGED INTO ?REVERSE?, SENDING THEM THROUGH A GAS STATION, AT FULL-THROTTLE, BACKWARDS.  AT THIS TIME, THE PASSENGER PANICKED.  SHE UNBUCKLED HER SEATBELT AND OPENED THE DOOR WHILE TRAVELING IN REVERSE.  THE DOOR MOMENTARILY PINED HER TO THE GROUND, RESULTING IN MAJOR FRACTURES OF THE HIP AND OTHER MINOR INJURIES.  THE CAR FINALLY CAME TO REST IN THE WOODS ADJACENT TO THE GAS STATION WITH MAJOR FRAME DAMAGE, A SEVERED FUEL LINE AND ALL FOUR WHEELS WERE DESTROYED.  MY WIFE WAS SHAKEN, BUT NO INJURIES.  WITNESSES STATED THEY CAME WITHIN INCHES OF HITTING THE GAS PUMPS.  AT THE TIME, MY FATHER-IN-LAW, A RETIRED GM MECHANIC BLAMED THE EVENT ON MY WIFE.  UNTIL I BECAME COMPUTER SMART AND HAVE READ SO MANY ARTICLES THIS WEEK ON FORD VEHICLES SURGING, I THOUGHT I HAD BETTER REPORT THIS INCIDENT TO HELP OTHERS WHO APPARENTLY HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE SAME EXPERIENCE.  *JB",MERCURY,COUGAR

THE DEGRADATION (CURLING) IS A CONSEQUENCE OF HEAT. I LIVE IN TUCSON AND APPARENTLY THE RATE AND PROBABILITY OF OCCURRENCE IS REGULAR AND WIDESPREAD. THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP DID ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HEAT WAS A FACTOR IN WHY THE PLASTIC NEEDLES CURL. CURLING PREVENTS THE SPEEDOMETER FROM OPERATING TO REGISTER CURRENT SPEED AS IF STUCK. THE DEALERSHIP DOES NOT COVER THE REPAIR EXCEPT TO REPLACE THE SPEEDOMETER/ODOMETER AT OWNER'S EXPENSE OR TO REFER TO A THIRD PARTY REPAIR AT OWNER'S EXPENSE. GIVEN THE RELIABILITY OF NISSAN VEHICLES THIS DEFECT IS A CLEAR SAFETY CONCERN SINCE THE SPEEDOMETER NEEDLE ONCE CURLED DOES NOT WORK. NO VEHICLE I'VE EVER OWNED REGARDLESS OF RELIABILITY HAS EVER HAD A DEFECT (CURLING) OF THE SPEEDOMETER NEEDLE, THEY OPERATE FOR THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE. TO HAVE TO SPEND $600+ OUT OF POCKET TO REPLACE A SPEEDOMETER WHICH ONLY NEEDS A NEEDLE REPLACEMENT TO RESTORE SAFETY TO THE OPERATION OF THE VEHICLE IS UNTENABLE. I WANT TO AVOID THE POSSIBILITY OF AN INCIDENT OCCURRING AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE SPEEDOMETER NOT OPERATING AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE CURLING DUE TO HEAT. *TR",NISSAN,NISSAN TRUCK

I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE UNIVERSITY GM DEALERSHIP IN DURHAM, NC AND REQUESTED INFORMATION ABOUT THE RECALL ON DECEMBER 16, 2006.

THEY ONLY RECENTLY EVEN ORDERED THE RECALL KIT ONLY TO THEN FIND OUT THE PARTS IN THAT KIT WERE ALREADY INSTALLED IN THE VEHICLE. NOW, THEY ARE TELLING ME THERE IS NOTHING MORE THEY CAN DO AND THAT THEIR POSITION IS THAT THE RECALL WORK APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AND SO THERE IS NOTHING FURTHER THEY WILL DO.  I WOULD LIKE TO BOTH LODGE A COMPLAINT ABOUT THEIR INACTION AND INABILITY TO OFFICIALLY CONFIRM THIS VEHICLE'S RECALL WORK HAS BEEN DONE AND ALSO REQUEST YOUR ASSISTANCE IN GETTING THIS INFORMATION FROM GM.

SO, WITH THIS BEING THE CASE I'M SURE IF YOU DO SOME RESEARCH YOU WILL FIND OUT WHAT I HAVE FOUND OUT THAT THE TARGA TOP, ALONG WITH ITS GASKETS ARE DEFECTIVE FROM THE PLANT.

PRESENTLY, I CAN NOT DRIVE IT ON A RAINY DAY BECAUSE I'LL BE SOAKED WITHIN JUST MINUTES OF THE DOWN POUR.  I THANK YOU FOR LISTENING, AND IF YOU ARE ABLE TO FIND OUT IF TOYOTA IS WILLING TO REPLACE THE FAULTY GASKETS AND TARGA TOP, I WOULD VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT.  CURRENTLY, I'M AFRAID TO DRIVE THE CAR BECAUSE I'M AFRAID THE POURING IN OF WATER IS GOING TO SHORT OUT THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM IN THE CAR.  I GUESS THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE IT IS, ITS LIKE HAVE SOMEONE POUR A PITCHER OF WATER ON YOU WHILE YOU DRIVE.  IN 1990 WHEN I PURCHASED THE CAR I USED A TOWEL IN MY LAP TO CATCH THE WATER, BUT KNOW THE LEAK IS SO BAD I WOULD PROBABLY NEED THREE TOWELS, AND SOME GOGGLES TO KEEP THE WATER OUT OF MY EYES.  I KNOW IF YOU LOOK INTO THIS FARTHER YOU WILL FIND PLENTY OF OTHER SUPRA OWNERS WITH MY SAME COMPLAINT.  BEING THAT THESE ROOFS AND SIDE DOOR GASKERS ARE FAULTY, THEY WILL IN NO DOUBT CAUSE HARM TO SOMEONE OR OTHER DRIVERS IF THEY ARE NOT FIXED.  I'VE HAD SEVERAL NEAR MISSES, BECAUSE OF THIS ON GOING PROBLEM.  PLEASE HELP ME GET SOME REPLACEMENT PARTS THAT WILL PREVENT THIS TYPE OF THING HAPPENING TO OTHERS.
