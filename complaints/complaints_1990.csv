THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN HOW THE BRAKES ""FELT"" WHEN APPLIED UNTIL THE MOMENT THEY SIMPLY FAILED.  THE LACK OF A SENSOR HAS LED TO AN EXTREMELY COSTLY REPAIR (ESTIMATED AT $2000 PARTS & LABOR).  MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT ALLOWED A SITUATION WHEREIN THE BRAKES COULD FAIL WITH NO DASHBOARD WARNING TO THE DRIVER.   I TOOK A COMPLETE LOSS ON THIS CAR IN TRADING IT IN.  I WAS PLANNING TO SELL IT ANYWAY, BUT I DIDN'T HAVE THE CASH TO FIX THIS HUGE PROBLEM, SO I JUST TRADED IT TO THE DEALER UNREPAIRED.  BECAUSE OF THE NON-OPERATIVE BRAKES, I RECEIVED $800 FOR A CAR WITH A BLUE BOOK VALUE OF AROUND $6,000.

SINCE THIS IS A CATASTROPIC FAILURE OF THE BRAKE SYSTEM WITH NO WARNING, I FIGURE YOU GUYS WOULD WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT.  I THINK THAT THIS IS NOT SPECIFIC TO REATTAS BUT WOULD AFFECT EVERY BUICK/GM VEHICLE WITH THE SAME ELECTRONICALLY CONTROLLED ABS SYSTEM.  MY MECHANIC SAID THAT THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO A BAD SWITCH THAT CONTROLS THE ELECTRIC PUMP.  THE PUMP BURNED OUT.  THERE SHOULD'VE BEEN A DASHBOARD WARNING ABOUT THE PROBLEM WHEN ONLY THE SWITCH WAS BURNED OUT, BUT THE SENSOR READING THE SWITCH HAD ALSO FAILED!!!  THAT LEFT ME WITH NO BRAKES AND NO WARNING.  THERE WAS NO PHYSICAL CHANGE IN HOW THE BRAKES FELT UNTIL THE TOTAL FAILURE OF THE SYSTEM!!!

THIS SYSTEM WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN ON THE DEFROSTER TO CLEAR THE WINDSHIELD FROM FOGGING UP WHEN THE OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE IS ABOVE 39 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT IF THE CAR IS LOW ON FREON.

THE SYSTEM SHOULD ALLOW AIR WARM AIR TO BE BLOWN ON THE WINDSHIELD TO DEFOG THE WINDSHIELD.

AFTER MANY REPAIRS AND REPLACEMENTS TO THE FRONT BRAKE SYSTEM . I DISCOVERED THAT THE ROOT CAUSE WAS THE  MALFUNCTION OF THE REAR BRAKES.  THE REAR CALIPERS ARE DESIGNED, THAT WHEN THEY CORRODE THE BRAKING ACTION IS DIMINISHED AND EVENTUALLY STOPS WHEN THE CALIPERS ARE COMPLETELY FROZEN. THIS FAILURE CAUSES SUBSEQUENT PROBLEMS :  1. BECAUSE THE FRONT BRAKES NOW CARRY MORE BREAKING LOAD THE PAD WEARS OUT VERY QUICKLY. 2. BECAUSE THE FRONT BRAKES NOW CARRY MORE BREAKING LOAD THE ROTORS WILL  WARP AND REQUIRE FREQUENT TURNING,  WHICH EVENTUALLY RENDERS THE ROTOR BELOW SPECIFIED THICKNESS AND MUST BE REPLACED .  3. THE REAR CALIPERS CAN SOMETIMES LOCK IN THE ENGAGED POSITION. THIS WILL CAUSE EXCESS AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS HEAT IN THE BRAKES. THIS WILL EVENTUALLY RUIN ROTORS AND MAY PRESENT A FIRE HAZARD.   4. THE LACK OF BREAKING IN THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE CAUSES AN IMBALANCE  IN THE BREAKING  CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VEHICLE. THIS WILL CAUSE THE VEHICLE TO LERCH SIDEWAYS IN AN EMERGENCY BREAKING SITUATION AS THE INERTIA FROM THE REAR IS NOT IMPEDED, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP WITH ANY CONTROL.

LUCKILY BECAUSE THE ROAD CONDITIONS WERE DRY AND TRAFFIC WAS LIGHT, I WAS ABLE TO GAIN CONTROL AND EVENTUALLY STOP THE VEHICLE.

CADILLAC NEVER OBTAINED MY CONSENT TO MAKE CHAGES TO MY CAR NOR WAS I EVER INFORMED BY CADILLAC OR CADILLAC DEALER OF SUCH WORK.  THE DEFECT IN THE ABS MASTER BRAKE SYSTEM IS A LATENT DEFECT AND THE OBLIGATION AND WARRANTY BY GM OF THE SERVICABILITY OF THEIR PRODUCTS NEVER EXPIRES.  I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT CADILLAC, NOTWITHSTANDING THE CAR'S AGE OF 21 YEARS BE INSTRUCTED TO FIX THE DEFECTIVE LEAKY ABS MASTER BRAKE SYSTEM. THIS LEAK HAS NOT RESULTED FROM USE AND WEAR  IT IS THE RESULT OF A INHERENT LATENT DEFECT IN THE MANUFACTURE OF THE CAR.  *TR",CADILLAC,SEVILLE

I FOUND A SQUARE PIECE OF PLASTIC THAT LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE TABLE WITH A HOLE IN THE TOP. I WANTED TO FIND OUT HOW IT GOT THERE SO I TOOK THE AIR CLEANER OUT AND FOUND THAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO HOLD THE CRANKCASE VENTILATION FILTER IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CANISTER. THE BAD THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT I WAS ON ICY ROADS AND THE ONLY WAY I COULD CONTROL THE VEHICLE WAS TO SHUT THE ENGINE OFF AND COAST INTO A DRIVEWAY. I ALSO REMEMBERED THIS HAPPENING TO THE 1991 PLYMOUTH GRAND VOYAGER THAT I USED TO OWN. THESE VEHICLES WERE PURCHASED USED AND THEREFORE, I SUSPECT THAT AT ONE TIME SOMEONE HAS RAN THESE WITHOUT A FILTER IN PLACE. THE BIG QUESTION IS,  OF ALL THESE VANS ON THE ROAD, HOW MANY HAVE BEEN RUN WITHOUT A FILTER. I HAD OWNED EACH OF THESE AT LEAST SIX MONTHS BEFORE THIS HAPPENED.

I DECLINED, WENT TO THE DEALER, AND THE IGNITION SWITCH WAS JUST HANGING OUT FROM THE HARNESS UNDER THE DASH, THE MECHANIC USED A SCREWDRIVER TO PUSH THE SWITCH AND STARTED THE VEHICLE FOR ME.    I THEN TOOK THE VEHICLE TO BUFFALO KEY AND LOCK, AND THE TECHNICIAN (RON CHASE) FOUND THAT THE INTERNAL MECHANISM IN THE STEERING COLUMN HAD BROKEN, AND HE STATED THAT IT IS A COMMON PROBLEM SINCE THE DEFECTIVE (RECALLED) IGNITIONS GENERALLY MELT AND WELD THEMSELVES IN THE ""START"" POSITION, WHEN THE DRIVER ATTEMPTS TO TURN IT OFF IT CAUSES THE RACK AND RODS INSIDE OF THE STEERING COLUMN TO BREAK, RENDERING THE IGNITION KEY ETC INOPERABLE.

Shortly after I got on the freeway the vehicle started to accelerate very quickly W/O pushing the gas pedal hit the brakes but only slowed from 65 mph to 60. Gas pedal did not move from middle position up or down and brakes seamed mushy. Cruise control was not on, tried switching it on then off. Could not slow down, so went to great effort to avoid hitting any other vehicles. trying to slow down for an off ramp came close to crashing off the the edge into a ditch.Tried the emergency brake and downshifting. Finally turned off the key and started slowing down, car lurched forward and hit a crosswalk button pole. Utility pole was damaged also cars bumper, grill, hood, radiator, brakes, possibly transmission. State patrol arrived, vehicle towed to tow yard lot. No ticket was issued. Vehicle never had this issue prior to the auto shop updates, I notified the shop but they have not followed up on anything - they stated that they would contact their insurance provider but I do not believe they have done so. ECM computer, software, fuel system sensors were possibly not installed correctly. Vehicle is available for inspection upon request. Has not been inspected since the incident.

APPROX 8 HWY MILES FROM HOME, PASSING THRU SMALL TOWN WITH 25-MPH LIMIT, SIGNAL LIGHT, AND RR CROSSING, THE FORD'S ENGINE SUDDENLY REVVED TO INCREDIBLY HIGH RPM'S. FRIGHTENED, I IMMEDIATELY PUSHED IN THE CLUTCH. NO FLOOR MAT OR STUCK ACCELERATOR/MECHANICAL PROBLEMS EXISTED. APPARENTLY THIS WAS A COMPUTER CAUSE. WITHIN SECONDS, PERHAPS 4 TO 8 SECONDS, I WAS PREPARED TO TURN OFF THE KEY IGNITION TO THE VEHICLE. I TRIED PRESSING THE ACCELERATOR ONCE (IN FORMER CARBURETED AUTOS, SUCH AN ACTION WOULD SETTLE A REVVED ENGINE NORMALLY). PRESSING ACCELERATOR HAD NO EFFECT. THEN WITHIN THAT RANGE OF JUST SECONDS, THE VEHICLE SETTLED ITSELF PRIOR TO MY REACHING A RAILROAD CROSSING. CONDITIONS INVOLVED SMOOTH ROADWAY, A GRADUAL DECLINE OF SPEED (NORMAL OPERATION THROUGH MOST OF THIS) FROM 55 TO 45 TO 35 TO 25 NEAR THE SIGNAL LIGHT AND ""DOWNTOWN"" AREA. I OWNED AND DROVE THE 1990 ESCORT FROM 1992 UNTIL 2006, FROM ABOUT 20,000 VEHICLE MILES TO ABOUT 184,000. THIS UNACCOUNTABLE ACCELERATION NEVER HAPPENED AGAIN. THE VEHICLE WAS FAMOUS FOR LOSING IGNITION MODULES. THE MOST DANGEROUS OCCASION INVOLVED APPROACHING THE SAME TOWN, ABOUT 6 MILES FROM HOME. AT 55 MPH, ENGINE STOPPED COLD. FORTUNATELY, I REALIZED SITUATION, PRESSED IN THE CLUTCH, AND WITHOUT POWER STEERING AND LITTLE POWER BRAKES COASTED INTO CHURCH PARKING LOT HANDILY NEAR. LATER, I TRANSPORTED WITH THE VEHICLE AT ALL TIMES A SPARE IGNITION MODULE AND NECESSARY TOOLS FOR INSTALLATION. THROUGH THE YEARS THE VEHICLE REQUIRED ABOUT 5 MODULES. AT OTHER TIMES THE ESCORT IDLED SO SLOWLY, THAT WHEN CLUTCH WAS DEPRESSED, VEHICLE WOULD STALL. FULL TUNE-UPS NEVER AFFECTED THE STALL TENDENCY. AS FAR AS TOYOTA'S CURRENT SUDDEN SURGES, I THINK THE PROBLEM IS VERY LIKELY COMPUTER RELATED.

PERHAPS THE ENGINE STALLED AND THE POWER STEERING WAS NO LONGER WORKING. THE CAR EVENTUALLY HIT THE RAISED CONCRETE RUMBLE STRIPS WHILE SKIDDING SIDEWAYS. THE CAR THEN FLIPPED OVER IN THE AIR AND TUMBLED DOWN THE MEDIAN, WITH THE FIRST IMPACT LIKELY TO THE DRIVER'S SIDE ROOF, KNOCKING OUT THE DRIVER. THE CAR CONTINUED TO TUMBLE DOWN THE MEDIAN UNTIL THE CAR VAULTED AND LANDED ON ITS TOP. I REMEMBER BEING UPSIDE DOWN IN THE AIR, BUT NOTHING ELSE UNTIL I CAME TO HANGING UPSIDE DOWN FROM MY SEAT BELT WITH BLURRED VISION.  I HAD 2 LARGE LUMPS ON THE TOP OF THE HEAD, A BADLY SWOLLEN JAW AND GUMS, A SWOLLEN TONGUE (BITTEN ON BOTH SIDES), ONE NOSTRIL FILLED WITH BLOOD, THE BACK OF MY HEAD NECK AND SHOULDERS WERE SWOLLEN BY WHAT FELT LIKE ABOUT 1/4 TO 1/2 INCH THICK. I HAD BRUISES AROUND MY RIGHT ELBOW, ON MY RIGHT THIGH, AND LIKELY OTHER PLACES, AS WELL AS A COMPRESSION FRACTURE OF THE SECOND LUMBAR VERTEBRA FROM THE BOTTOM (L4?). SINCE I HAD DIFFICULTY BREATHING, THEY DID A TRACHEOTOMY ON ME WHILE WAITING FOR THE AMBULANCE. THEY PRIED OPEN THE REAR HATCH TO GET ME OUT OF THE VEHICLE. I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL 5 DAYS, OUT OF WORK 5 WEEKS, AND IN VARIOUS DEGREES OF PAIN FOR ABOUT 1 YEAR.  THE ROOF FAILED TO PROTECT ME, THE INERTIA LOCK SHOULDER HARNESS FAILED TO PREVENT MY CHIN FROM HITTING THE STEERING WHEEL AND ITS FAILURE TO WORK LIKELY RESULTED IN THE COMPRESSION FRACTURE WHICH THE DOCTOR SAID WAS PROBABLY FROM LUNGING FORWARD. THE ONLY THING THAT KEPT ME IN THE CAR WAS THE MANUAL ADJUSTED LAP BELT, WHICH IS NO LONGER INSTALLED IN FORDS. ALL BELTS ARE INERTIA LOCK, LIKE THE SHOULDER BELT OF THIS CAR WAS.

FOR THE PAST WEEK THE GAS HAS BEEN GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE TWO TANKS.  I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I CAN FILL THE FRONT TANK AND PUT 1/4 TANK OF GAS IN THE REAR TANK.  THEN AN HOUR LATER THE REAR TANK IS HOLDING THE GAS FROM THE FRONT TANK.  THE BIG PROBLEM HAPPENED TODAY WHEN I FILLED THE REAR TANK AND THEN PUT $5 WORTH IN THE FRONT TANK.  I HAD A 70 MILE DRIVE HOME. WITHIN THE FIRST 20 MILES THE REAR TANK WHICH I HAD FILLED, WAS READING 1/4 FULL!  SO I SWITCHED TO THE FRONT TANK WHICH WAS EMPTY EXCEPT FOR THE $5 WORTH OF GAS I HAD PUT IN.  HOWEVER, THE FRONT TANK WAS NOW READING FULL!  OBVIOUSLY THE GAS HAD GONE SOMEHOW FROM THE REAR TANK AND UP TO THE FRONT TANK.  BY THE TIME I GOT ABOUT HALF WAY HOME, THE CAB OF THE TRUCK WAS FULL OF FUMES.  I STOPPED AND GOT OUT BECAUSE I DEVELOPED A TERRIBLE HEADACHE.  THERE WAS GAS POURING FROM THE UNDERSIDE OF THE TRUCK.  UPON CLOSER INSPECTION, I REALIZED THE GAS WAS SPILLING OUT FROM THE REAR TANK AT THE AREA WHERE THE GAS GOES IN AT.  WHEN I CHECKED THE GAUGES THE REAR TANK WAS NOW FULL (REMEMBER 30 MINUTES EARLIER IT WAS ONLY 1/4 FULL AND THE FRONT TANK WAS READING FULL),.

THE TRUCK HAD ONLY 27000 MILES ON IT WHEN I PURCHASED IT.  I THOUGHT IT  NEEDED A TUNE UP.  HOWEVER, A COMPLETE TUNE UP WHICH I HAD AT APPROXIMATELY 50,000 MILES DID NOT FIX THE OCCASIONAL STALLING.  I  WAS TOLD AFTER A DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEMS CHECK THAT IT WAS THE EGR VALVE AND I HAD THAT REPLACED.  IT DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  NOW, WITH THE HEAT OF THE SUMMER THE PROBLEM IS GETTING WORSE WITH IT STALLING WHENEVER  I SLOW DOWN FOR CURVES, HIGHWAY EXITS,  ETC.  WHEN I HAVE ASKED A LOCAL FORD DEALER PARTS PERSON ABOUT THE STALLING PROBLEM THEY HAVE STILL POINTED TO THE EGR VALVE.  BUT AFTER HEARING YESTERDAY'S NEWS REPORT ABOUT THE TFI MODULE AND COMPARING  MY STALLING PROBLEMS TO WHAT I HAVE LEARNED, I WOULD SAY THAT IT IS THE TFI MODULE.  THIS STALLING COULD DEFINITELY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.  TO REPLACE THE MODULE THE DEALER COST WOULD BE $99.87 FOR THE PART,  PLUS LABOR.  I REALIZE THAT AFTER 3 YEARS OF OWNING THIS VEHICLE I NOW HAVE 82,000 MILES ON IT BUT THIS HAS BEEN AN ON GOING PROBLEM AND IT IS NOT SAFE.

I HAD TO PUT 3 TRANSMISSIONS IN THE CAR (IN ABOUT END OF FEBRUARY, AGAIN IN ABOUT 3 WEEKS ANOTHER ONE HAD TO BE PUT IN) I ONLY PAID ABOUT $1,100.00 FOR THE TRANSMISSION AND THE OTHERS WERE COVERED BY THE MECHANICS WARRANTY.  THE TRANSMISSION THAT WAS IN THERE WAS FRIED WHEN THEY SOLD IT TO ME. A RIM HAD TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE IT WAS BENT WHICH COSTED $45.00. I HAD TO REPLACE THE COOLING SYSTEM ($800.00) (JUNE 24 2003) BECAUSE IT WAS NOT WORKING AT ALL. THE ENGINE HAD OVER HEATED CAUSING THE RADIO TO MALFUNCTION.

IN ANY EVENT, I CALLED THE DEALER (CENTURY FORD IN ROCKVILLE, MD) TODAY ASKING ABOUT THE ENGINE MOUNT DETERIORATION RECALL AND WHETHER THE REPLACEMENT OF THE FRONT AND REAR ENGINE MOUNTS SHOULD ALSO BE TAKEN CARE OF AT NO COST TO ME. THE DEALER ADVISED THAT THE PARAMETERS OF THAT RECALL WERE IN EFFECT ONLY FOR 60,000 MILES OR 6 YEARS. THEY SAID MY CURRENT MILEAGE, ABOUT 69,000, PUTS MY CAR OUTSIDE THAT LIMIT AND THEREFORE FORD WOULD NOT PAY THEM TO DO THAT WORK. (I.E. I MUST PAY.) I HAVE SINCE CALLED FORD AND ASKED THEM ABOUT THIS SITUATION AND THEY JUST SAID THEY'D DO NOTHING.

CHECKING WITH INDEPENDENT MECHANICS, I WAS TOLD THAT THIS ABS PROBLEM HAS BEEN OBSERVED BEFORE IN OTHER JAGUARS, ALTHOUGH NOT NECESSARILY THIS CATASTROPHICALLY, AND THAT THEY FELT THAT A RECALL SHOULD HAVE BEEN ISSUED BUT NEVER WAS.  THEY EXPRESSED SURPRISE THAT JAGUAR WOULD NOT OFFER TO ASSIST WITH THE REPAIR.  I FEEL THAT YOU SHOULD INVESTIGATE THIS - I SUGGEST YOU START BY CALLING THE KEN SMITH @ ROSENTHAL JAGUAR 703-893-1700.  EVEN INEXPENSIVE CARS PERFORM BETER THAN THIS EXPENSIVE JAGUAR.  JAGUAR NEEDS TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR SAFETY-RELATED DEFECTS LIKE THIS. *",JAGUAR,SOVEREIGN

AN AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR SHOP REPLACED THE MASTER CYLINDER AT A COST OF $600. THE BRAKES FAILED AGAIN AFTER THE MASTER CYLINDER WAS REPLACE. THE FAILURE WAS REPORTED TO CHYSLER WHO SUGGESTED A SECOND DEALER TO CHECK THE ABS SYSTEM. THE SECOND DEALER PERFORMED A SERIES OF TEST TO THE VEHICLE BRAKING SYSTEM AND DETERMINED THAT THE ABS ACCUMULATOR PUMP ASSEMBLY WAS DEFECTIVE AND REPLACED IT AT A COST OF MORE THAN $319.00.

THE FAILURE WAS REPORTED TO THE DEALER, WHO SUGGESTED THAT THE VECHILE WAS UNSAFE TO DRIVE AND TOWED IT BACK FOR EXAMINATION.

THEN I CHECKED WWW.ALLDATA.COM AND FOUND THAT FORD WAS AWARE OF THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS THROUGH A CHECK OF THE FOLLOWING SERVICE BULLETINS: ATRATB331; ATRATB267; 94247; ATRATB029; AND 89225. BECAUSE OF THE SERVICE BULLETINS MENTIONED ABOVE, FORD WAS AWARE OF THE PROBLEMS AND FAILED TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS. AS A CONSUMER, I WOULD LIKE FORD TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSION AT NO COST TO MYSELF. THE OTHER PROBLEM IS THE ENGINE COOLING FAN. ON 12 DECEMBER 2002 WHILE SITTING IN TRAFFIC, I NOTICED SMOKE COMING FROM UNDER THE HOOD AND SMELLED WIRES BURNING. I PULLED OVER IN A PARKING LOT OF A SHOPPING CENTER RIGHT WHEN THE COMPUTER SIGNALED THAT THE ENGINE TEMPERATURE WAS HIGHER THAN NORMAL. I TURNED THE ENGINE OFF AND OPEN THE HOOD TO LOOK FOR THE BURNED WIRED. THE ELECTRIC ENGINE FAN HAD SEIZED UP AND STARTED TO MELT THE WIRES. THE FUSE HAD FAILED TO BLOW, AND I HAD TO UNPLUG THE FAN FROM THE WIRING HARNESS TO KEEP THE WIRES FROM BURNING MORE.",LINCOLN,CONTINENTAL

MILEAGE ON THE CAR WAS APPROXIMATELY 35,000 MILES. CURRENT MILEAGE IS 54,000 MILES. TREAD WEAR WAS MINIMAL TO DATE WITH PLENTY OF TREAD REMAINING. IN JULY 2000 THE LEFT FRONT TIRE (FIRESTONE ATX 27X8.50R14LT) DEVELOPED A SIGNIFICANT BULGE IN THE TREAD. ON AUGUST 3RD 2000, I REPLACED THE TIRE AT FIRESTONE TIRE AND SERVICE CENTERS 201 HAMAKUA DR. KAILUA, HI. 96740. ONE WEEK LATER CONCERNS REGARDING FIRESTONE'S ATX TIRES SURFACED. LAST WEEK ON SEPTEMBER 2ND, 2000 MY RIGHT REAR TIRE (FIRESTONE ATX 27X8.50R14LT) DEVELOPED A BULGE IN IT'S TREAD. I REPLACED IT WITH THE SPARE TIRE AND CALLED THE FIRESTONE DEALER. THE DEALER STATED THAT MY TIRE WAS NOT PART OF THE VOLUNTARY RECALL BECAUSE IT WAS A SIZE 14 INCH TIRE NOT THE RECALLED SIZE OF 15 INCHES.  AS FAR AS I KNOW THE FIRESTONE ATX TIRES I HAVE ARE IDENTICAL IN DESIGN AS THOSE BEING RECALLED. FURTHERMORE I CHECKED THE DOT CODE AND FOUND THAT THE CODE ON THE TIRES (VDK6AXC104) INDICATE THEY WERE MANUFACTURED IN THE DECATUR, ILLINOIS PLANT WHICH IS THE ONE IN QUESTION. I AM CONCERNED THAT MY TIRES DEVELOPED THESE BULGES WITHIN DAYS OF EACH OTHER, THAT THEY ARE THE SAME TIRES INDICATED IN THE SAFETY CONCERN EXCEPT FOR SIZE, AND THEY WERE MANUFACTURED IN THE PLANT IN QUESTION. SINCE MY TIRES WERE AN ""ODD"" SIZE TIRE (14 INCH) THEY WOULD NOT BE AS POPULAR AS THE COMMONLY FOUND (15 INCH) TIRE ON FORD EXPLORERS, AND THEREFORE WOULD NOT ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF YOUR INVESTIGATION REGARDING THEIR SAFETY. I WOULD SUGGEST IN THE INTEREST OF PUBLIC SAFETY THAT THE INVESTIGATION, AND IF WARRANTED RECALL BE EXPANDED TO ALL SIZED ATX AND WILDERNESS TIRES ESPECIALLY IF THEY WERE PRODUCED AT THE DECATAUR PLANT.

I DROVE THE CAR FOR ONE BLOCK NOTICEING THAT THE STEERING DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT. AS I DROVE FROM THE STOP SIGN, THE CAR SHOOK VIOLENTLY AS IF IT HAD JUST BEEN HIT. I LOST CONTROL OF THE CAR(NO STEERING),AND HIT A TELEPHONE POLE, WRECKING THE FRONT END. UPON INSPECTION OF THE CAR, I FOUND THE MOTOR SITTING ON THE GROUND DETACHED FROM THE CAR. I HAD THE CAR TOWED HOME. IT WASN'T UNTIL TWO WEEKS LATER THAT I FOUND OUT ABOUT THE RECALL ON THE CRADLE BOLTS. I THEN TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT. TWO WEEKS LATER I RECIEVAD A PHONE CALL FROM SOMEONE AT GM. THE MAN I TALKED TO SAID THAT THEY WOULDN'T FIX MY CAR BECAUSE (THE WAY HE DESCRIBED IT) THE FRAME SURROUNDING THE CRADLE BOLT HAD RUSTED, NOT THE CRADLE BOLT ITSELF. IN MY OPINION, ANY SPOT ON A PEICE OF METAL THAT STARTS TO RUST WILL CUASE THE SURROUNDING AREAS OF METAL TO RUST ALSO. WHEN I EXPLAINED THIS TO HIM,HE INSISTED THAT THIS WAS NOT TRUE AND THAT GM WAS NOT LIABLE FOR THOSE KIND OF CIRCUMSTANCES. IN ALL, HE TOLD ME THAT GM WOULD NOT EVEN BE ABLE TO JUST REPLACE THE RECALLED PART BECAUSE OF THE EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO THE SUBFRAME,AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR ALL REPAIRS TO THE CAR. I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS VERY UNSATISFIED WITH HIS DECISION,AND HE SAID THAT HE STILL REFUSED TO EVEN TRY TO HELP. AFTER THAT, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I STOPPED MAKING PAYMENTS. TWO WEEKS LATER, I ARRIVED HOME FROM WORK TO FIND THAT MY CAR HAD BEEN TOWED BACK TO MY HOUSE AND LEFT WITH THE KEYS IN THE IGNITION AND NO PRIOR NOTIFICATION OF THIS. I LET THE CAR SIT AND AS A RESULT OF NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO AND NOT MAKING PAYMENTS, THE CAR WAS REPOSSESSED.

PRIOR TO THE ENGINE FALLING ONTO THE GROUND, THIS WAS A DEPENDABLE, EXCELLENT RUNNING VEHICLE.  I CAN ONLY HOPE THAT THERE WAS NO DAMAGE TO THE ENGINE WHEN THE BOLTS FAILED.

I HAVE HEARD THIS TO BE A PROBLEM WITH 900'S THAT HAVE OVER 100,000 MILES ON THEM BUT HAVE FOUND NO RECALLS. I WAS DOING 65 MPH AT THE TIME IT BROKE BUT IF THIS HAD BEEN SOMEONE ELSE OR IF I HAD BEEN GOING FASTER YOU COULD HAVE LOST CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE, LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER WITH MINOR DAMAGE.     THIS FAILURE DID NOT HAPPEN IN REVERSE AS MOST PEOPLE CLAIM.........IT HAPPENED WHILE MOVING FORWARD AT 65 MPH.........THIS IS MY CONCERN. IF THE ARM FATIGUES AT THE WELD STRESS POINT AND BREAKS WHILE BACKING UP JUST IMAGINE HOW BAD THE CRACK MUST BE BEFORE THIS HAPPENS. SINCE THE LOAD CAN'T BE AS GREAT ON THE ARM AS IT IS WHEN AT SPEED AND TURNING THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM THAT I WILL INVESTIGATE FURTHER. I WILL POST PIC'S AS SOON AS I GET IT BACK FROM THE SHOP. I SENT THIS E-MAIL TO SAAB CUSTOMER RELATIONS AND I'M WAITING FOR A RESPONSE WHICH I WILL FORWARD. I ALSO POSTED THIS ON SEVERAL SAAB WEBSITES.    PLEASE IF ANYONE KNOWS OF SAFETY RECALLS FOR THIS LET ME KNOW, ALSO IF ANYONE KNOWS WHO TO CONTACT TO REPORT THIS I WOULD APPRECIATE A CONTACT SINCE THIS COULD LEAD TO SOMEONE GETTING HURT OR EVEN KILLED.    ATT: SAAB USA    I POSTED THIS ON SAABNET.COM AND HAVE HAD SEVERAL PEOPLE WITH THE SAME ISSUE E-MAIL ME. I'M ALSO GOING TO FORWARD THIS TO THE NHTSA SINCE I FEEL THIS IS A POTENTIALLY A SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT SHOULD BE FIXED WITH A RECALL. I HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO INFORM OTHERS OF THIS AND WILL INVESTIGATE THIS MORE TO SEE IF ANYONE HAS BEEN SERIOUSLY HURT OR KILLED FROM THIS PROBLEM.

IN 2001 I WENT TO TOYOTA FOR THIS PROBLEM AND THEY TOLD ME I WOULD NEED TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION SO I SHOULD DRIVE THE VEHICLE UNTIL I COULD NOT DRIVE IT ANYMORE.  AT THAT POINT I SHOULD HAVE THE TRANSMISSION REPLACED.   AFTER EXTENSIVE RESEARCH I LOCATED TSBS FOR THIS VEHICLE AND FOUND ONE THAT ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE (TSB ATRATB351 DATED JAN 96).

AFTER STICKING, LOCK BUTTON COULD NOT BE MOVED MANUALLY, WITH THE POWER LOCK SWITCH, OR WITH THE KEY FROM THE OUTSIDE.  DRIVER WAS LOCKED IN.  CAUSE WAS DETERMINED TO BE STICKING LINKAGE THAT OVERPOWERED THE RETURN SPRING.  LUBRICATION SOLVED THE PROBLEM (FOR THE TIME BEING), BUT NOT UNTIL AFTER THE DOOR WAS DISMANTLED.  POOR DESIGN LEAVES A SMALL SPRING TO OVERCOME ANY LINKAGE FRICTION CAUSED BY WEAR, DIRT BUILDUP, CORROSION, LACK OF LUBRICATION, ETC.  AFTER PROBLEM WAS DIAGNOSED, STICKING SITUATION COULD BE CREATED ON DEMAND BY SIMPLY PULLING THE INSIDE DOOR HANDLE WHEN THE LOCK KNOB WAS DOWN.  STICKING LINKAGE WAS VERY CONSISTANT.  IN MY OPINION, THIS REPRESENTS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE, AS THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS FOR THE DRIVER TO TRY TO OPEN THE DOOR WITHOUT FIRST UNLOCKING IT IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION AND BEING LOCKED IN THE CAR WITH NO RECOURSE.  THIS PROBLEM IS WORSENED BY THE FACT THAT THE IDENTICAL FAILURE OCCURRED INDEPENDENTLY IN THE PASSENGER SIDE LOCKING MECHANISM LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER IT OCCURRED ON THE DRIVER SIDE.  BOTH LINKAGES STUCK IN THE SAME SPOT AND BOTH WERE REPEATABLE.  THIS INDICATES TO ME THAT THERE'S A DESIGN PROBLEM THAT REVEALS ITSELF AS THE MECHANISM AGES AND WEARS, AND IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE LOOKED INTO FOR THE SAFETY OF THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS, ESPECIALLY THOSE INVOLVING LOSS OF POWER WHICH WOULD PROHIBIT EXIT THROUGH THE POWER WINDOWS.",TOYOTA,CAMRY

ONLY THE ALERTNESS OF THE TRUCK DRIVER BEHIND ME IN SLOWING QUICKLY PREVENTED AN ACCIDENT. THE JACKSON WY DEALER COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE.  ON A RECENT TRIP TO WYOMING FROM CALIFORNIA THE INTERMITTENT POWER LOSSES REOCCURRED.

THE VW DEALER IN IDAHO FALLS CONFIRMED THAT ALL SUCH WIRING HARNESSES SHOULD BE REPLACED, BUT STATED THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR IT AS THERE WAS NO RECALL BY VW. THE PROBLEM IS EXPLAINED IN THE VW TECHNICAL BULLETIN 24 93-07 DATED NOVEMBER 15, 1993.

VW SHOULD INFORM ALL OF THOSE OWNERS AS THEY SHOULD HAVE INFORMED ME AND VW SHOULD REPLACE THE WIRING HARNESSES AT NO COST TO THOSE OWNERS.

IMMEDIATELY, THE CAR ACCELERATED OUT OF CONTROL AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND DIDN'T STOP UNTIL WE WERE INSIDE MY NEIGHBORS HOUSE, STOPPED ONLY BY THE INTERIOR WALL OF HIS HOME.  WE WENT BACKWARDS THROUGH HIS FRONT GATE, HIS EXTERIOR WALL AND ENDED UP COMPLETELY INSIDE HIS DEN/GAME ROOM.  I WAS NOT ABLE TO STOP IT WITH THE BRAKES AND THERE WAS NO EXPLAINABLE REASON FOR THE MALFUNCTION, BUT IT WAS BIZARRE TO SAY THE LEAST.  THERE WAS EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO HIS HOME AND MY CAR, BUT LUCKILY NO ONE WAS KILLED.  MY HUSBAND WAS TRANSPORTED TO THE HOSPITAL FOR NECK INJURIES SUSTAINED IN THE ACCIDENT AND THE CAR IS NOW IN A WRECKING YARD.
