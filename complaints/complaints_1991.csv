CAUTIOUSLY MOVING OFF FROM THE STOP, THERE WAS A COMPLETE LOSS OF STEERING CONTROL; THE STEERING WHEEL JUST SPUN FREELY, WHILE THE VEHICLE TRACKED ALMOST STRAIGHT AHEAD.  SINCE THERE WAS STILL POWER AND BRAKING, THE DRIVER WAS ABLE TO ROLL TO A STOP ON THE RIGHT SHOULDER OF THE ROAD.  (IF THE LOSS OF STEERING CONTROL HAD OCCURRED THREE MINUTES LATER, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AT 65 MPH ... WITH POSSIBLY FATAL CONSEQUENCES.)  IN THIS VEHICLE THE ENGINE, TRANSMISSION, FRONT SUSPENSION, AND STEERING RACK ARE MOUNTED ON A SUBFRAME.  THE SUBFRAME, IN TURN, IS ATTACHED TO THE PRIMARY STRUCTURAL FRAME OF THE VEHICLE WITH FOUR BOLTS M12X1.25 BOLTS; THE ATTACHMENTS INCLUDE RUBBER BUSHINGS TO PROVIDE SOME SHOCK ISOLATION BETWEEN THE SUBFRAME AND THE REST OF THE VEHICLE. THERE IS A STEEL SLEEVE WHICH INSERTS INTO THE INNER BORE OF THE ISOLATION BUSHINGS, AND THROUGH WHICH THE MOUNTING BOLT IS INSERTED.  (SEE ILLUSTRATION FROM GENERAL MOTORS ""1991 BUICK REGAL SERVICE MANUAL,"" P. 10.3.3, FIGURE 1.)  THERE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN NO CORROSION PROTECTION PROVIDED OR APPLIED TO THESE SUBFRAME ATTACH COMPONENTS DURING VEHICLE ASSEMBLY.  UPON INSPECTION, THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS DETERMINED TO BE FAILURE OF BOTH REAR SUBFRAME ATTACHMENT BOLTS AND/OR ISOLATION BUSHINGS DUE TO SEVERE CORROSION IN SERVICE.  IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE BOLT FAILURES, THE FRONT SUSPENSION SPRINGS FORCED THE REAR OF THE SUBFRAME DOWNWARD, RESULTING IN THE STEERING COLUMN SHAFT DISCONNECTING ENTIRELY FROM THE STEERING RACK ASSEMBLY.",BUICK,REGAL

THIS HAPPENED ON MY OTHER ALLANTE AS WELL (NU126027)  THE CAR WAS LOW MILEAGE, IN PERFECT SHAPE, AND INSPECTED CONSTANTLY.  IT HAPPENED WITHOUT WARNING.  THAT CAR HAD TO HAVE THE ENTIRE HYDRO SYSTEM REPLACED ALONG WITH $6,000 IN OTHER BRAKE COMPONENTS BEFORE THE COMPUTER SAID THE BRAKING SYSTEM WAS SAFE (A TOTAL OF $8,500.IN PARTS/SERVICE).  IT TOOK 7 WEEKS BECAUSE CADILLAC WOULDN'T RESPOND TO SERVICE QUERIES BY MY DEALER.

AT LUNCH, I DROVE THE VEHICLE TO LUNCH, PARKED IN THE PARKING LOT ON A SLIGHT INCLINE, AND WENT TO LUNCH.  UPON RETURNING, WE FOUND A SMALL GROUP OF ANXIOUS PEOPLE LOOKING AT MY CAR FROM A SHORT DISTANCE.  GASOLINE WAS LEAKING OUT FROM UNDER IT, AND HAD RUN ABOUT 15' DOWN THE PAVEMENT, FORMING A PUDDLE.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD BEEN CALLED, AND WAS ON THEIR WAY.  WE MANUALLY PUSHED THE CAR AWAY FROM THAT SPOT, ONTO LEVEL GROUND, AND THE DRIPPING FUEL STOPPED.  WHEN WE GOT THE CAR ON A LIFT, IT TOOK THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN ABOUT 30 MINUTES TO IDENTIFY A CRACK IN A MOLD SEAM.  HE REMOVED THE TANK, REPLACED IT WITH A NEW ONE, AND I DROVE TO THE NEAREST CHEVROLET DEALER, (JOHN SMITH @ 770 953 0100), WHOSE SERVICE MANAGER HAD NEVER HEARD OF A GAS TANK SPONTANEOUSLY FAILING.  HOWEVER, HE COULD SEE THAT THIS TANK HAD NOT HIT ANYTHING.  HE REFERRED ME TO THE GM HELP LINE 800 NUMBER.  (800 222 1020)  THEY HAD ALSO NOT HEARD OF THIS PARTICULAR FAILURE, AND AFTER APPROXIMATELY 20 MINUTES ON HOLD, CAME BACK ON AND TOLD ME THAT THIS FAILURE WOULD NOT BE WARRANTED, AS THE CAR WAS TOO OLD, IN SPITE OF THE LOW MILEAGE ON THE VEHICLE.  THEY ALSO OPENED FILE #990 470 854.  I ASKED IF IT WAS REASONABLE FOR ME TO EXPECT MY GAS TANK TO NOT LEAK, AND WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS.  I REALIZE THAT GM IS SENSITIVE ABOUT GAS LEAKS.  WELL, I HAVE, IN MY BACK YARD, A GAS TANK THAT LEAKS, AND WOULD LIKE SOMETHING MORE THAN THEIR SYMPATHY.  THE NEW OEM TANK COST ME OVER $600.  HAD THE GAS IGNITED, WE WOULD NOT HAVE THE TANK TO EXAMINE.  I WOULD LIKE THEM TO AT LEAST WANT TO SEE THE TANK, AND THINK ABOUT THE PROBLEM.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.",CHEVROLET,CAPRICE

I then mounted those tire/wheel combinations onto the vehicle.  I then drove the vehicle to the same garage for a yearly state inspection, and on my way there the steering wheel shimmied half of the time.  When I got there I checked the lug nuts for any looseness with a torque wrench.  All lug nuts were accurate.  After the inspection I drove the car back to my garage (under 25 miles round trip) and removed all 4 tire/wheel combos, loaded them into my truck and brought them back to the garage to drop them off to have them balance checked in between the mechanics other jobs ahead of me.  The mechanic checked them and  informed me that all 4 were balanced accurately, as a matter of fact, he did them in front of me so I could see.  He recommended that I take them to a shop that has a ""Road Force Balancer"".  I found such a shop and after they tested all 4 tires, in front of me, they indicated that the 2 front could not be balanced, that they were ""out-of-round"" beyond balancing.  One rear combo was passable and the other was just barely out of reach, but could possibly be used.  It may even out after so many miles.  I asked him if the rims could be the problem and he indicated to me that the machine he uses also measures the wheel itself, and he showed me how it does it.  All 4 rims measured true.

I PURCHASED THEM WHEN MY CAR HAD 57,358 MILES ON 03/19/94.  I DROVE APPROXIMATELY 20,000 MILES PER YEAR.  ALL THE PREVIOUS TIRE FAILURES WERE BLOWOUTS I HAD WHILE DRIVING WITH MY FAMILY ON THE HIGHWAY.  EACH TIME I WENT TO THE FIRESTONE SERVICE CENTER FOR PRORATED TIRE REPAIRS.  THEY KEPT TRYING TO BLAME MY BLOWOUTS ON MY ALUMINUM WHEEL RIMS ALTHOUGH I NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH MY PREVIOUS UNIROYAL TIRES.  IN 1998 AFTER YET ANOTHER TIRE PROBLEM I SWITCHED TO MICHELINS, AND I HAVE SINCE SOLD THE VEHICLE IN 8/99.  AT THE TIME OF THESE PROBLEMS, I WAS CONCERNED AS TO THE AMOUNT OF BLOWOUTS I HAD, AND UNTIL THE RECALL CAME OUT I  THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE OF SOME RELEVANCE TO YOU.  I HAVE ALL MY ORIGINAL PAPERWORK FROM FIRESTONE.  MANY OF THE REPLACEMENT TIRES I HAD CARRIED IN TO THE STORE SO I DON'T HAVE EXACT MILAGE OF THE TIRES.  I DO POSSIBLY HAVE AT LEAST ONE OF THESE TIRES ON MY PROPERTY BUT IT WOULD REQUIRE SOME EFFORT TO RETRIEVE AND FIND IT.

THE NEW ABS MODULE STARTED MALFUNCTIONING IN JUNE OF 2012, STARTING WITH SMALL CHIRPING NOISES THEN GROWING LOUDER INTO SQUEALS AND GRINDING FROM THE ABS PUMP MOTOR ITSELF. THE VEHICLE WAS RETURNED TO THE DEALER, WHERE IT WAS DETERMINED THE PUMP HAD FAILED AND A NEW ONE WAS INSTALLED.  THE CONSUMER CALLED CHRYSLER TO INFORM THEM, THE PUMP THAT WAS INSTALLED IN 2010 HAD FAILED AND THE VEHICLE WAS IN THE SHOP FOR WARRANTY REPAIR. WHEN THE CONSUMER'S SON PICKED UP THE VEHICLE AND LEFT THE PARKING LOT, THE ABS WARNING LIGHT ILLUMINATED AND THE VEHICLE LOST 90% OF ITS ABILITY TO STOP. THE MECHANIC STATED THERE WAS A SHORT IN THE ABS PUMP MOTOR WHICH CAUSED THE BRAKES TO FAIL. AFTER CONTACTING CHRYSLER AGAIN, THEY AUTHORIZED ANOTHER ABS PUMP TO BE INSTALLED. AFTER THE INSTALLATION, THE ABS WARNING LIGHT STARTED ILLUMINATING OFF AND ON INTERMITTENTLY. THE CONSUMER MADE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO HAVE THE DEALER RESOLVED THE ISSUE BY HAVING THEM KEEP THE VEHICLE FOR WEEKS AT A TIME, AND WE THE VEHICLE WAS PICKED UP, THE ABS WARNING LIGHT WAS STILL ON. THE CONSUMER LEARNED TO DEAL WITH THE LIGHT, UNTIL ONE DAY, WHILE SHE WAS DRIVING, THE ABS PUMP BEGAN MAKING A LOUD GRINDING NOISE AND STOPPED ALL TOGETHER. CHRYSLER ADVISED THE CONSUMER TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO A REPAIR SHOP OF HER CHOICE. THE CONSUMERS MECHANIC DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS A FAULTY ABS PUMP.  WHEN CHRYSLER WAS CONTACTED AGAIN, THE CONSUMER WAS INFORMED THE PART WAS NO LONGER AVAILABLE. HOWEVER, THE REPAIR SHOP STATED THEY HAD ONE. CHRYSLER CLAIMED, THEY WERE UNABLE TO LOCATE THE PUMP UNDER WARRANTY, AND THEY WERE CLOSING THE CASE.",CHRYSLER,IMPERIAL

THE THING I FIND HERE IS THE TERM REGARDING PISTON ASSEMBLY WHEN I TOOK MY VAN IN DUE TO FAILURE ONLY THE PISTON ASSEMBLY WAS REPLACED IT SHOULD BE REVISED TO INCLUDE THE WHOLE UNIT BECAUSE A ACCUMULATOR MADE OF CAST IRON THAT IS CONNECTED TO THE UNIT IS NEVER REPLACED RUST KEEPS ENTERING THE UNIT FROM THIS ACCUMULATOR BEING IT IS MADE OF A RUSTING METAL AND JUST KEEPS MAKING THE UNIT FAIL THIS IS MY SECOND REPAIR IN 2YRS AND THE RUST IS NOW GETTING INTO THE LINES CAUSING THE REAR WHEELS TO LOCK IN WET WEATHER ALL THE PARTS STORES THAT EVEN CARRY THE UNIT WHICH IS FEW SELL IT AS A COMPLETE UNIT NOT IN PIECES SUCH AS WITH OTHER MASTER CLY.

I TALKED TO TWO DEALERS AND THEY DO NOT HAVE THE PART AND ARE NOT HAVING ANY LUCK FINDING. I AM STILL IN TOUCH WITH THE ONE IN CORDELE AND HE IS LOOKING FOR THE PART.   FIAT CHRYSLER SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE NOT MY LOCAL DEALER FRO RESOLVING THIS.  MY DODGE CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE CENTER REFERENCE NUMBER IS: 33027978 EMAIL CASE NUMBER:  3572678  SO FAR THE TRUCK IS FINE BUT IF OR WHEN THE THROTTLE BREAKS, THE TRUCK WILL RUN WIDE OPEN AND EVEN POSSIBLY NOT SHUTDOWN.  I NEED THE TRUCK FIXED ASAP AS I CAN'T AFFORD TO KEEP IT OFF THE ROAD. A NEW RE-MANUFACTURED PUMP IS AROUND $1500 PLUS LABOR SO I CAN NOT AFFORD TO FIX IT MYSELF AND IT IS NOT MY PLACE TO SINCE IT IS A RECALL.    THANKS",DODGE,RAM 1500

THE TRUCK HAS THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM AS THE OTHER MANY FORD TRUCKS. WHILE IDLING, OR UNDERWAY, THE VEHICLE SPEWS GASOLINE FROM THE FRONT TANK, OUT ONTO THE ROAD, OR ANY DRIVEWAY, IF IDLING.  IT'S CLEAR THAT ONCE YOU FILL THE REAR TANK AND THEN TRAVEL, THE FUEL, WHICH SHOULD RETURN TO THE REAR TANK IN A CYCLE, DOES NOT. IT SIMPLY RETURNS TO THE FRONT TANK, UNTIL IT FILLS THE FRONT TANK AND FLOODS OUT. THE PUMP IN THE REAR TANK APPEARS TO JUST CONTINUE TO RUN, FOR EXAMPLE,,,,  YOU HAVE A FULL REAR TANK. YOU HAVE HALF A TANK OF FUEL IN THE FRONT TANK. YOU DRIVE. THE REAR TANK PUMP, PUMPS ALL OF THE FULL REAR TANK INTO THE FRONT TANK. SO, HALF A TANK OF GAS FLOWS OUT OF THE FRONT TANK, ONTO THE GROUND.  OBVIOUSLY, THE CYCLE, WHERE THE FUEL SHOULD GO FROM REAR, TO ENGINE AND BACK, ISN'T HAPPENING. INSTEAD, THE FUEL ROLLS BY THE ENGINE AND RETURNS TO A FULL FRONT TANK, RATHER THAN THE REAR TANK, SO, ONTO THE GROUND GOES THE FUEL.   ON AN OLDER RECALL REPORT, THE REPAIR IS DESCRIBED, WHERE THE 'JUMPER' MUST BE REPLACED, DESPITE THE FACT THERE'S NO SUCH THING, THERE'S A FUEL PUMP AND PROBABLY SOME SORT OF 'BI-VALVE' THAT SOMEONE'S POOR ENGINEERING FAILED ON THE WHOLE, AT THE TIME OF DESIGN.

THIS IS THE ONLY CASE OF A DOOR LATCH JUST FAILING IN ANY VEHICLE THAT I OR ANY OF MY FAMILY/FRIENDS HAVE EVER OWNED.  THIS COST OVER $700 TO REPAIR (SINCE THE DOOR WAS JAMMED SHUT)AND ALTHOUGH HONDA HAS UNOFFICIAL DOCUMENTS ABOUT THE DRILLING (FROM THE INSIDE) PROCEDURE TO RELEASE THE JAMMED LATCH, THEY HAVE NO OFFICIAL DOCUMENT RELATING TO THIS.  WHEN I CONTACTED THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP, AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE REGIONAL SERVICE MANAGER, I WAS BASICALLY TOLD ""SORRY, YOUR CAR IS PAST THE WARRANTY"" - END OF STORY. FROM THE REPORTS I HAVE SEEN ON THIS WEB SITE AND IN TALKING WITH A LOCAL HONDA MECHANIC, IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS FAILURES OF THIS TYPE.  THIS LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE ORIGINAL DOOR LATCH DESIGN IS DEFECTIVE, SINCE I HAVE NEVER OWNED ANY CAR (OF ANY AGE) OR EVEN HEARD OF A CAR (BESIDES THE ACCORD REPORTS I GOT FROM THIS WEB SITE AND THE LOCAL HONDA MECHANIC) WHERE THE DOOR LATCH JUST FAILED.  I BELIEVE THAT THIS REPRESENTS A MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD, SINCE IF THE LATCH MECHANISM IS PRONE TO FAILURE WITHOUT ANY OUTSIDE INFLUENCE, THEN THAT MECHANISM WILL BE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO FAIL IN THE EVENT OF A CRASH, JAMMING THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR SHUT AND PREVENTING EASY EXIT FROM THE VEHICLE.  I BELIEVE THAT THE HONDA CORPORATION SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO CORRECT THIS DEFICIENCY BY REPLACING THE FAULTY DOOR LATCH MECHANISMS, OR AT LEAST OFFERING TO COMPENSATE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE HAD TO SPEND WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE AN INORDINATE SUM OF MONEY TO REPAIR A MANUFACTURING DEFECT.  IT HAS TAKEN ME NEARLY A YEAR TO GET AROUND TO WRITING THIS, AND I WOULD BE WILLING TO BET THAT FOR EACH PERSON WHO FILES A COMPLAINT WITH THE NHTSA THERE ARE HUNDREDS MORE WHO DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOUR AGENCY OR DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO FILE A REPORT.

IF THE OPERATOR HAS MOVED THE SHIFT LEVER INTO THE 1-2 GEAR SHIFT POSITION FOR BETTER CONTROL AND ENGINE BRAKING AND THE VEHICLE SPEED DROPS BELOW 28 TO 23 MPH THE TRANSMISSION WILL WITHOUT WARNING ABRUPTLY DOWNSHIFT TO FIRST GEAR.  IF THE VEHICLE IS ON WET, ICY OR GRAVEL COVERED ROADS IT WILL GO INTO A SKID CONDITION USUALLY WITH LOSS OF VEHICLE CONTROL.  WHEN I TOOK THE VEHICLE INTO THE DEALER TO HAVE THEM FIX THE PROBLEM, THEY SAID THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE PROBLEM AND CONTACTED CHRYSLER.  CHRYSLER REPLYED THAT THIS WAS NORMAL OPERATION AS PER ITS DESIGN.  OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO I CONTACTED CHRYSLER DIRECTLY INCLUDING THEIR ENGINEERS.  THE SAID THEY WERE AWARE OF THE DESIGN DEFECT, HOWEVER NOT ENOUGH CUSTOMERS HAD COMPLAINED ABOUT THE CONDITION TO WARRANT THEM TAKING CARE OF THE PROBLEM.  OF COURSE IT IS NOT MENTIONED IN THEIR OPERATORS MANUAL, AND IF SOMEONE LOST CONTROL THEY WOULD PROBABLY NOT HAVE A CLUE AS TO WHAT HAD CAUSED IT.  I THEN CAME UP WITH ELECTRONIC CIRCUITRY THAT COULD BE INCORPORATED IN THE VEHICLES TRANSMISSION CONTROL UNIT THAT FIXED THE PROBLEM.  I OFFERED IT TO THE COMPANY IN 1992 SO THEY COULD MAKE IT EITHER AVAILABLE TO THEIR PAST CUSTOMERS AND TO RE-DESIGN THE CIRCUITRY INTO THE NEW CHEROKEES PRODUCED SINCE THAT TIME.  THEY DECLINED THE OFFER.  THE DESIGN CHANGE WOULD NOT HAVE COST THEM MORE THAN $10.00 PER VEHICLE FOR RETROFITTING PAST VEHICLES AND LESS THAN $5.00 PER VEHICLE TO INCORPORATE THE CIRCUITRY INTO NEWLY MANUFACTURED VEHICLES.

I TURNED THE DIMMER CONTROL AND THE DASH LIGHTS WOULD ONLY BE ON FULL BRIGHTNESS OR OFF, THERE WAS NO DIMMER CONTROL. APPROXIMATELY 60 SECONDS LATER WE COULD SMELL SOMETHING HOT. APPROXIMATELY 2 MINUTES LATER WE NOTICED A GLOW COMING FROM UNDER THE LEFT SIDE OF THE DASH BOARD. WE WERE CLOSE TO OUR HOME AND TURNED INTO THE DRIVEWAY, AT WHICH TIME I WAS FORCED TO OPEN THE DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW DUE TO BLACK SMOKE COMING FROM THE LEFT AIR CONDITIONING VENT. I PULLED UP TO THE GARAGE,SHUT OFF THE IGNITION, PULLED THE HOOD RELEASE AND EXITED THE CAR. MY WIFE GOT OUT OF THE PASSENGERS SIDE AND IMMEDIATLY HEADED FOR THE HOUSE TO GET WATER. I HURRIED INTO THE GARAGE TO RETRIVE A PAIR OF PLIERS  TO PULL THE BATTERY GROUND CABLE. AS I EXITED THE GARAGE FLAMES WERE VISABLE ABOVE THE DASH INSIDE THE JEEP. I POPPED THE HOOD AND PULLED THE GROUND CABLE OFF, BY THIS TIME THE FLAMES WERE REACHING THE TOP OF THE WINDSHIELD. I MOVED AROUND TO THE DRIVERS DOOR AND OPENED IT AS MY WIFE ARRIVED WITH A BUCKET OF WATER AND WE WERE SUCCESSFUL; IN EXTINGUISHING THE FLAMES. THE  REOSTAT FOR THE DASH LIGHTS HAD SHORTED OUT AND DID NOT BLOW THE FUSE. THE LIGHT SWITCH BECAME HOT ENOUGH TO IGNITE THE PLASTIC SURROUNDING THE MAIN WIRING HARNESS ABOVE IT, MELTING THE AIR CONDITIONER VENT, THE LEFT SIDE OF THE DASH AND BURNING THE HEADLINER AND SUN VISOR. HAD WE NOT BEEN CLOSE TO HOME I BELIEVE THE VEHICLE WOULD HAVE BURNED COMPLETELY AS WE WOULD HAVE HAD NO MEANS OF PUTTING OUT THE FIRE.  A FELLOW EMPLOYEE TOLD ME HE HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIANCE WITH A 1989 JEEP CHEROKEE.

THE POWER STEERING PUMPS ARE KNOWN TO SPRING LEAKS.  THEY ARE LOCATED DIRECTLY OVER THE ALTERNATOR CHARGING SYSTEM AND THE LEAKING FLUID SHORTS OUT THE ALTERNATOR, LEADING TO FAILURE.  I HAVE HAD TWO OF THESE AND BOTH WERE LEAKING AND AFTER RESEARCHING, ITS HARD TO FIND A 1990-94 LS400 ON THE ROAD THAT DOES NOT HAVE A LEAKING POWER STEERING PUMP.  THE PUMP SEALS SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER MANUFACTURED, PLACED IN A DIFFERENT CONFIGURATION, OR A ""ALTERNATOR GUARD"" PLACED OVER THE ALTERNATOR TO KEEP THE FLUID FROM SEEPING INTO THE ALTERNATOR CAUSING THE PREMATURE FAILURE.  I HAVE SEEN A COUPLE OF THESE WITH FIRES IN THIS AREA AND CAN UNDERSTAND IT BEING A POSSIBILITY WITH THE POWER STEERING OIL LEAKING DOWN INTO THE ALTERNATOR.  SO, NOT ONLY DO THE PUMPS LEAK EXTERNALLY (THEY ALSO LEAK INTERNALLY AND SUCK INTO THE ENGINE), BUT THEY ALSO RUIN THE ALTERNATOR AND CAUSE A POTENTIAL FIRE HAZARD.      ANOTHER PROBLEM AREA WITH THIS SAME CAR IS THE HVAC CONTROLS WILL TURN BLACK AFTER A FEW YEARS, CREATING A SAFETY HAZARD, BECAUSE YOU CANNOT SEE WHAT YOUR HEATING/DEFROSTER SETTINGS ARE AT NIGHT.  *TR",LEXUS,LS400

AS AN INDIVIDUAL WITH TWO ACADEMIC DEGREES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING, I COULD NOT SIT BY WITHOUT EVALUATING THE CAUSE OF THIS ISSUE AND PASS ALONG SOME HELPFUL SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT. IT SEEMS THAT THE LENGTH OF THE SEATBELT IS INADEQUATE TO ALLOW ENGAGEMENT, LEAVING ME IN A VERY UNSAFE POSITION WHEN DRIVING YOUR VEHICLE.  I HAVE OWNED NUMEROUS CARS AND TRUCKS AND HAVE FOUND THIS TO BE THE CASE IN ONLY TWO OF THEM.  ONE IS MY PRESENT CAR, THE 1991 LINCOLN CONTINENTAL, AND THE OTHER WAS A 1997 FULL SIZE DODGE RAM PICKUP TRUCK. THE BASIC PROBLEM IS LACK OF BELT LENGTH TO WRAP AROUND THE MID-DRIFT OF A LARGE PERSON.  IT IS DISTURBING TO THINK THAT EVEN AN AVERAGE SIZED PREGNANT WOMAN MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH THIS SAME ISSUE IN YOUR VEHICLE.  IN MY CASE, THE SEAT IS IN THE FULL REAR POSITION AND I HAVE AMPLE ROOM BETWEEN MY MID-DRIFT AND THE STEERING WHEEL (ABOUT 2-3 INCHES).  I DO CONSIDER MYSELF A LARGE MAN, BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT A SEATBELT SHOULD BE ABLE TO PERFORM FLAWLESSLY WITH ANY TYPE OF BODY STYLE THAT CAN COMFORTABLY OPERATE YOUR AUTOMOBILE. WHAT IS THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM?  REDESIGN THE SEATBELTS WITH LONGER BELTS.  AS AN ENGINEER, I WOULD SAY THAT ANOTHER 16"" WOULD SUFFICE.  I HOPE THAT THESE OBSERVATIONS MAY HELP YOU MAKE A BETTER PRODUCT FOR YOUR CUSTOMERS.  A LINCOLN CONTINENTAL AND DODGE RAM TRUCK ARE BOTH LARGE VEHICLES DRIVEN BY LARGE PEOPLE, LETS MAKE THEM SAFE AS WELL.  I WILL ALSO EMAIL COPIES OF THIS LETTER TO YOUR SALES AND MARKETING DEPARTMENT, AND VARIOUS SAFETY ORGANIZATIONS.  HOPEFULLY YOUR ENGINEERS WILL FIND THIS INFORMATION USEFUL.  I WOULD ALSO APPRECIATE IF YOUR ENGINEERS COULD MAKE UP A 12-16"" SEATBELT EXTENSION THAT I COULD USE TO ENGAGE MY RESTRAINT SYSTEM.

I TOOK THIS VEHICLE TO AN AUTHORIZED MAZDA DEALER WHO PROCEEDED TO TAKE A FULL 10 MINUTES TO LOOK AT THIS VEHICLE AND TELL ME THERE WAS NOT A PROBLEM WITH IT.  I PREVIOUSLY FILED A COMPLAINT AND TO MY KNOWLEDGE DID NOT RECEIVE ANY FEEDBACK.  DURING THE TIME I HAD THIS FAILED COMPONENT ON MY FUEL SYSTEM, I DEVELOPED A CHRONIC ASTHMA CONDITION.  ANOTHER DEALER FINALLY FOUND A CRACK IN THE FUEL VAPOR SEPARATOR ONE YEAR LATER WHEN I TOOK THIS VEHICLE BACK FOR ANOTHER INSPECTION.  IT TOOK 4 MONTHS AFTER THE SECOND MAZDA DEALER FOUND THE CRACK FOR ME TO OBTAIN A REPLACEMENT PART FOR THE FAILED COMPONENT.  THE DEALER NEVER INFORMED ME IT WAS UNSAFE TO CONTINUE DRIVING THIS CAR REEKING OF FUEL ODORS.  I WOULD LIKE AN INVESTIGATION TO BE CONDUCTED ON A FORMAL LEVEL.  I BELIEVE MAZDA FAILED TO INFORM THEIR CUSTOMERS OF DANGERS ASSOCIATED WITH DRIVING A CAR THAT MAY HAVE FUEL VAPORS LEAKING INTO THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT OF THE VEHICLE.  I BELIEVE THE AUTHOIRZED DEALER FAILED TO WARN OF THE POTENTIAL DANGERS OF FUEL ODORS IN THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT OF THE VEHICLE.  IT SEEMS BY READING THE RECALL LETTERS ISSUED IN APRIL 1998 AND JAN 1999 THAT THE FIRST LETTER REFLECTED AN ATTITUDE OF NONCHALANCE, AND MAZDA IMPLIED THAT THERE WAS REALLY NO CAUSE FOR CONCERN, OR TRUE BELIEF THAT THIS RECALL SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.  THOUGH I DID TAKE IT SERIOUSLY AND HAD MY CAR INSPECTED FOR THE FAILED COMPONENT, THE AUTHORIZED MAZDA DEALER DID NOT SEEM CONCERNED THAT I, A CONSUMER IN GOOD FAITH, WAS PLACED IN HARMS WAY.  ALONG WITH MY CHILDREN.  PLEASE RESPOND TO MY REQUEST AND ADVISE IF I NEED TO CHANNEL OR REDIRECT MY EFFORTS TO HAVE THIS INVESTIGATION REQUEST SOMEWHERE ELSE.

IN FACT, HE HAD REBUILT MANY OF THESE AND KNEW HOW TO ""MODIFY"" THE UNIT TO PREVENT FURTHER PROBLEMS.  MY QUESTION:  DOESN'T THE MANUFACTURER HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY HERE?  I AM IN THE PROCESS OF CONTACTING NISSAN AND WILL AWAIT THEIR FORMAL RESPONSE.  IN THE MEANTIME, CAN YOU HELP ME GET THIS PROBLEM RESOLVED?  I AM CONVINCED THERE ARE MANY MORE CONSUMERS OUT THERE DRIVING THESE VEHICLES WHO ARE AT RISK.  *AK",NISSAN,240SX

AFTER DRIVING THE CAR BACK HOME (WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY) AND INVESTIGATING THE SEATBACK SUPPORT STRUCTURE, I FOUND THE METAL FRAME WAS SHEARED IN TWO AT THE LOWER LEFT PORTION OF THE SEATBACK.  THE NEXT DAY I USED A BOARD TO PROP THE SEAT UP TEMPORARILY, AND DROVE IT TO THE DEALER FROM WHOM I PURCHASED THE CAR NEW IN 1991.

SOME PEOPLE SUFFERED INJURIES DUE TO THIS SEAT FAILURE, AND THAT MAKES IT A SERIOUS SAFETY DEFECT THAT SHOULD REQUIRE MORE INVESTIGATION SINCE THE MANUFACTURER THINKS THIS IS WITHIN ""ACCEPTABLE LIMITS' CONSIDERING THE NUMBER OF THESE CARS SOLD.

WHILE ON OCCASION A CALIPER OR WHEEL CYLINDER MAY GO BAD-THIS DESIGN IS SERIOUSLY FLAWED IN IT'S ENGINEERING CONCEPT. THE PHENOLIC PISTONS DO NOT DISSIPATE HEAT PROPERLY, AND BECAUSE OF THE DESIGN FLAW OF WHERE THE CYLINDER PROTRACTS WHEN IT MEETS THE STEEL BACKING OF THE BRAKE PAD LEAVES FULLY 1/3 OF THE PISTON FULLY EXPOSED TO UNNECESSARY HYDRAULIC PRESSURES. IT IS EXACTLY AT THIS JUNCTURE WHERE A SERIOUS FRACTURE OCCURS ON THE PISTON, RENDERING THE BRAKE DANGEROUSLY INOPERABLE.

LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO BRAKE AND MANEUVER THE VEHICLE TO THE SHOULDER.  UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION I REALIZED THE ONLY REASON I WAS ABLE TO MANEUVER THE VEHICLE TO THE SHOULDER BY PRESSING THE BRAKES IS BECAUSE THE DRIVERS SIDE REAR CRADLE BOLT ON THE DRIVERS SIDE WAS MISSING WHICH CAUSED THE ENGINE AND ENTIRE FRONT END TO DROP AND TWIST TO THE RIGHT WHEN THE BRAKE WAS APPLIED.

I GOT IN MY CAR AND EVEN BEFORE I PUT MY KEY IN THE IGNITION I HEARD A STATIC/CRACKLING SOUND COMING FROM THE REAR SPEAKERS.  IT DIDN'T OCCUR TO ME RIGHT AWAY THAT THE CAR ENGINE WAS OFF SO I SHOULD NOT HAVE HEARD THE RADIO AT ALL.  AS I STARTED THE CAR I HIT THE RADIO BUTTON THINKING THE RADIO WAS ON BUT HAD LOST THE STATION.  THE NOISE DID NOT GO AWAY WHEN I HIT THE BUTTON AND I REALIZED THE CAR WAS FILLING WITH SMOKE, COMING FROM INSIDE THE UPPER DASH (AREA OF RADIO) IN THE FRONT OF THE CAR.  I IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER AND SHUT THE ENGINE OFF AND GOT OUT OF THE CAR.  SMOKE CONTINUED TO COME FROM THE AIR VENTS.  IT SEEMED TO HAVE A ELECTRICAL BURNING SMELL (I'VE WORKED IN LABS AND STARTED A FEW MYSELF...) VERSUS A GAS OR OIL OR OTHER BURNING SMELL.  WHEN THE SMOKE CLEARED, I CHECKED THE REST OF THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM AND THE LIGHTS AND AIR CONDITIONING AND DIGITAL CLOCK WORKED FINE.  THE CAR REALLY DOESN'T HAVE ANY MUCH ELSE I COULD CHECK, NO ELECTRIC DOOR LOCKS, ETC.  I PULLED THE RADIO FUSE.  IT WAS NOT BLOWN.  I STARTED THE CAR WITH FRIENDS WATCHING AND THE ENGINE APPEARED TO BE FINE.  I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE HOME A 5 MILE RIDE WITH NO APPARENT PROBLEM.  THE RADIO/CASSETTE PLAYER WERE INSTALLED WHEN I BOUGHT THE CAR.  I USE IT ALL THE TIME AND NEVER HAD PROBLEMS BEFORE.  MY CONCERN HERE IS COULD THE CAR HAVE CAUGHT FIRE JUST SITTING IN THE PARKING LOT OR AT ANY OTHER TIME FROM THIS ELECTRICAL (?) PROBLEM?  THIS COULD HAVE BEEN DANGEROUS HAD I BEEN ON A MAIN ROAD WITH MY YOUNG CHILD STRAPPED IN THE CAR SEAT.

THE PROBLEM THAT I WAS HAVING WAS NEVER DUPLICATED BY THE VOLVO DEALER THAT LOOKED AT IT.

I RECOGNIZED THE POTENTIAL FOR DANGER THAT THIS SITUATION HAS FROM THE MOMENT I STARTED HAVING PROBLEMS, BUT DUE TO THE APATHY OF THE SERVICE ADVISER AND THE MANAGER AT THE VOLVO CENTER HERE I WAS HESITANT TO CONTACT NHTSA.
