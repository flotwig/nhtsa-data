I DROVE THE CAR FOR LESS THAN 7 DAYS AND PUT ON ABOUT 100-150 MILES ON SUBURBAN STREETS AND HIGHWAYS.  WHEN MY TIRE DEALER REMOUNTED THESE NEW TIRES ON NEW WHEELS HE DISCOVERED THAT 3 OF THE 4 TIRES HAD DANGEROUS SIDEWALL BUBBLES.  SO FAR THE DISTRIBUTOR AND THE MANUFACTURER CLAIM THE TIRES WERE DAMAGED DUE TO A POT HOLE (3 TIRES ON TWO DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE VEHICLE).  MY TIRE DEALER AND LONG TIME AUTOMOTIVE TECHNICIAN (TECHNICAL ADVISOR TO THE BMW CAR CLUB OF AMERICA) SAY IT IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR 3 OF THE 4 TIRES TO HAVE BEEN DAMAGED BY A POT HOLE OR ROAD HAZARD.  FURTHERMORE, WHEN THE TIRE DEALER INSPECTED THE TIRES BEFORE REMOUNTING THEM, HE FOUND THEM ALL TO BE PHYSICALLY PERFECT--NO SIGNS OF BRUISING, PUNCTURES OR GLASS DAMAGE.   THE TIRE DISTRIBUTOR AND MANUFACTURER SAY THERE IS EVIDENCE OF ROAD HAZARD DAMAGE INSIDE THE TIRE WHERE THERE IS A SPLIT.  THE TRUTH IS THAT WHAT THEY HAVE FOUND IS EVIDENCE THAT THREE OF THEIR 4 TIRES FAILED AFTER BARELY A FEW DAYS OF NORMAL USE ON REGULAR NEW YORK STATE ROADS.  PIRELLI EMPHASIZES THAT THESE TIRES WERE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR THE NORTH AMERICAN MARKET.  THEN ONE WOULD THINK THEY COULD LAST MORE THAN A WEEK ON NORTH AMERICAN ROADS.   THE TIRE DISTRIBUTOR SO FAR REFUSES TO REPLACE MY 3 TIRES AND THE MANUFACTURER SO FAR AGREES WITH THE DISTRIBUTOR.   I HAVE REVIEWED HUNDREDS OF OWNER REVIEWS FOR THE TIRES I PURCHASED ALONG WITH SIMILAR MODELS FROM THIS COMPANY AND I FOUND MANY REPORTS OF SIMILAR SIDE WALL FAILURES.  GIVEN THE PROPENSITY OF THESE TIRES TO DEVELOP DANGEROUS DECOMPOSITION OF THE SIDEWALLS WITH NORMAL USE WITH LOW MILEAGE,I AM ASKING THAT YOUR AGENCY INVESTIGATE THESE TIRES AND CONSIDER A NATIONAL RECALL TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC.  *NM",BMW,535I

THIS IS THE ORIGINAL FACTORY BRAKE UNIT FOR THIS AUTOMOBILE. THE PRESSURE SWITCH DEVELOPED A CRACK, ALLOWING THE BRAKE FLUID TO BE PUMPED OUT. MY FATHER WAS DRIVING THE VEHICLE AT THE TIME, AND MANAGED TO GET THE CAR STOPPED AND OFF THE ROAD WITHOUT CRASHING. NEVERTHELESS, THE RESULTS COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH DIFFERENT. WHAT'S MORE, I KNOW NOW THAT GM HAS LONG BEEN AWARE OF THIS DEFECT.     SINCE THIS OCCURED, I HAVE LEARNED THAT GM WAS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM FOR QUITE SOME TIME, AND ISSUED A RECALL FOR THIS PARTICULAR PART (PRESSURE SWICTH) AS WELL AS FOR THE DIVIDER VALVE.  UPON CONTACTING THE LOCAL GM DEALER (DALLAS AUTOMOTIVE GROUP, JACKSON, OH.) I WAS INFORMADE THAT MY VEHICLE WAS NOT COVERED BY THIS RECALL. IN FACT, I WAS TOLD THAT IT ONLY APPLIED TO 2 VIN!     FINDING IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT A RECALL WAS ISSUED, BUT FOR ONLY 2 VEHICLES, I CONTACTED GM CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE. I TALKED WITH GREG MARTIN, CUSTOMER RELATIONS MANAGER, AND WAS INFRMAED THAT MY BUICK'S VIN WAS NOT AMONG THOSE COVERED. HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO THE GM SERVICE BULLETIN REGARDING THIS BRAKE PROBLEM, ALL PRESSURE SWITCHES THAT ARE BLACK IN COLOR ARE TO BE REPLACED, ALONG WITH THE ""O' RING SEAL. IT FURTHER STATES THAT AFTER REPLACING THIS PART WITH THE GRAY REPLACEMENT PART, SERVICE PERSONELL SHOULD CHECK THE DIVIDER VALVE . IF IT IS CAST IRON, IT IS TO BE REPLACED WITH A BRASS VALVE.    IN SPITE OF ALL THIS, THEY MAINTAIN THAT THIS VEHICLE IS NOT COVERED. FURTHER, THEY CLAIM THIS VEHICLE IS NOT EFFECTED EVEN THOUGH THE PART FAILED, AND DID SO IN THE EXACT MANNER DESCRIBED IN THE SERVICE BULLETIN.    I BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE SIMPLY NOT HONORING THE RECALL BECAUSE I AM NOT THE ORIGINAL OWNER, AND DON'T HAVE THE ORIGINAL RECALL NOTICE. THEY ARE MERELY THUMBING THEIR CORPORATE NOSES AT THE SAFETY ISSUES INVOLVED IN TOTAL BRAKE SYSTEM FAILURES.*AK",BUICK,ESTATE

I AM CONVINCED THE PROBLEM WAS CAUSED BY THE TRANSMISSION OVERHEATING AND PRESSURE BLOWING THE FLUID OUT THE DIPSTICK TUBE. AT THE TIME WE WERE PULLING A BOAT (18' PONTOON BOAT) DOWN ALABAMA INTERSTATE 65 SOUTH WHEN WE HEARD SEVERAL EXPLOSIONS UNDERNEATH THE VEHICLE. IT WAS APPROX. 4:45 AM ON 6/18/99. I LOOKED OUT MY SIDE WINDOW AND SAW LARGE BRIGHT ORANGE AND YELLOW REFLECTIONS ON THE PAVEMENT INDICATING A SEVERE FIRE UNDERNEATH OUR VEHICLE (THERE WERE NO INDICATIONS OF A PROBLEM BEFORE THE EXPLOSIONS OCCURRED). WE WERE APPROACHING AN OVERPASS WITH AN 18 WHEELER DIRECTLY BEHIND US AND ANOTHER VEHICLE OVERTAKING US IN THE LEFT PASSING LANE. THERE WAS NO SAFE PLACE (SHOULDER) TO STOP. I PROCEEDED ACROSS THE OVERPASS AND PULLED OVER IMMEDIATELY. WE FEEL VERY FORTUNATE THAT WE WERE NOT INJURED AND THAT THE ENTIRE VEHICLE AND BOAT DID NOT BURN TOTALLY. ONCE I GOT STOPPED, I POPPED THE HOOD, SAW THE FLAMES THROUGH THE DENSE SMOKE, RACED TO THE BOAT, RETRIEVED THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER, RACED BACK AND PUT MOST OF THE FIRE OUT. AFTER COMPLETELY EXPELLING THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER, SMALL FLAMES WERE STILL VISIBLE. I QUICKLY RETRIEVED 2 GALLONS OF WATER THAT WE HAD IN THE BACK OF THE TRUCK AND PUT THE REMAINDER OF THE FIRE OUT WITH IT. THERE IS CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE UNDER THE HOOD BUT APPARENTLY NOT ENOUGH FOR THE TRUCK TO BE CONSIDERED ""TOTALED"" BY MY INSURANCE COMPANY. AFTER WALKING TO THE NEAREST PHONE I DIALED 911. A LOCAL VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPT. WAS DISPATCHED. A FIRE TRUCK AND FIREMAN ARRIVED SHORTLY THEREAFTERE AND INSPECTED UNDER THE DASH AND HOOD THOROUGHLY TO MAKE SURE THE FIRE WAS TOTALLY OUT. A REPORT WAS FILLED OUT BY THE FIREMAN. THE TRUCK AND BOAT WERE TOWED BACK TO MY DAD'S RESIDENT THAT MORNING BY TATE'S WRECKER SERVICE IN ATHENS AL. (NOTE: THE TRUCK IS A 2 OWNER.

DURING THAT SEARCH WE FOUND A RECALL NOTICE, SO WE CHECKED OUR OWN RECORDS AND FOUND THE ORIGINAL RECALL NOTICE THAT CHEVROLET MAILED TO US IN 1991, AND AN APRIL 1991 NOTE THAT THEY REFUSED TO PERFORM THE SERVICE BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM. WE HAVE ALL OF THE VEHICLE?S SERVICE RECORDS AND THERE IS NO RECORD, OR RECOLLECTION, THAT THE REPAIR WAS EVER PERFORMED.      WE CALLED CHEVROLET?S CUSTOMER SERVICE AND LEARNED THAT ONE DATABASE SHOWS THAT OUR 1986 CORVETTE IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE REPAIR, BUT ANOTHER DATABASE (OPEN RECALL DATABASE?) DOES NOT SHOW OUR VIN# SO THEY WON?T PERFORM THE REPAIR.  IN JUNE 2014 A LOCAL DEALER, WHO ALSO REFUSED TO PERFORM THE RECALL SERVICE,  SURMISED THAT OUR VIN# DOES NOT APPEAR BECAUSE IN APRIL 1992, WHEN THE RECALL SERVICE WAS ORIGINALLY REFUSED, THE DEALER PROBABLY REMOVED IT FROM THE RECALL DATABASE (BUT WE WERE NOT INFORMED OF THIS NOR DOES CHEVROLET HAVE ANY RECORD OF IT.)

SEEING AS THE TIRES WERE OLD, I FELT THIS WAS ABOUT THE BEST I COULD EXPECT.  I DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF IT UNTIL I HEARD ABOUT THE PROBLEM WITH FIRESTONE LIGHT TRUCK TIRES ON THE RADIO TODAY.  I STILL HAVE MY ORIGINAL RECEIPT FOR THE TIRES AND MAY STILL HAVE A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE TIRE THAT WAS REPLACED IT TEXAS.  OBVIOUSLY, I NO LONGER HAVE THE TIRES.

I AM THE MOTHER OF A 2 YEAR OLD THAT WAS BURNED TO DEATH IN A 1986 FORD ESCORT THAT WAS NOT ON IN THE PARKING LOT OF A GROCERY STORE. YES IT HAS BEEN OVER 20 YEARS, BUT DURING THE COURSE OF THIS TIME I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET ANYONE TO LISTEN TO MY STORY.     WELL, THIS PARTICULAR CAR WAS A RENTAL FROM BUDGET RENTAL IN GLENVIEW ILLINOIS AND WE WERE ON A FAMILY OUTING. ALL WAS WELL AND THEN WE STOPPED OFF TO GET SOME FIRE WORKS. I COULD ONLY AFFORD SMOKE BOMBS AND SPARKLES. NEEDLESS TO SAY WHEN THIS HORRIFIC EVENT OCCURRED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT STATED THAT THIS WAS THE REASON THE CAR CAUGHT ON FIRE. THAT IS NOT TRUE. YOU CAN'T START A FIREWORK WITHOUT A LIGHTER. THE RENTAL CAR DID NOT HAVE A CIGARETTE LIGHTER OR THERE WERE NO MATCHES.     I FOUND A NEWS ARTICLE DATE IN THE VIRGINIAN PILOT, APRIL 18, 1996, TEN YEARS LATER STATING THAT THERE WAS AN IGNITION PROBLEM IN CARS DATED AS FAR BACK AS 1984. PLEASE FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS I HAVE HAD TO LIVE WITH THIS MINI MOVIE PLAYING IN MY HEAD OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITH NO RESOLUTION. THIS IS NOT ABOUT MONEY OR FAME. MY CHILD DIED BEFORE HE COULD SEE WHAT LIFE IS LIKE WITH HIS FAMILY. HERE IS A COPY OF THE ARTICLE. I NEED HELP. THIS INCIDENT HAS CRUSHED MY FAMILY. MY OLDEST SON AND I HAD TO WITNESS THIS UNABLE TO HELP MY BABY.    YOU WONDER WHY IT TOOK ME SO LONG TO WRITE THIS LETTER, IT IS VERY HARD FOR ME TO DO THIS NOW. I NEED CLOSURE. EVERY YEAR ON THIS DATE, I SIT AT HIS GRAVE SITE AND WONDER WHAT WENT WRONG. I RENT CARS ALL THE TIME AND I AM IN FEAR OF ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN. BUT IT WAS STATED THAT THERE WAS A KNOWN FACT OF A PROBLEM. ALTHOUGH ACKNOWLEDGED 10 YEARS LATER, BETTER LATE THAN NEVER. YOUR COMPANY HAS IMPROVED DURING TRIAL AND ERROR, HOWEVER, DID MY SON HAVE TO DIE DURING THE ERROR PART.  *TR",FORD,ESCORT

I PURCHASED A USED TROOPER THREE YEARS AGO, AND HAVE EXPERIENCED NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS. I PURCHASED THE TROOPER FROM MY NEIGHBOR THREE YEARS AGO.HE PURCHASED IT FROM A DEALER HERE IN MAINE. THE TROOPER WAS ALWAYS VERY WELL MAINTAINED,USUALLY GARAGED, AND ONLY DRIVEN BY MY NEIGHBOR TO HIS PALCE OFF BUSINESS 3 MILES AWAY. HE HAD TO REPLACE THE HEAD WHICH WAS DEFECTIVE. I HAVE SINCE LEARNED FROM AREA GARAGES THAT THIS IS A RECURRING PROBLEM. MY PROBLEMS ARE CENTERED AROUND THE POOR CONSTRUCTION OF THE FRAME. THE BODY OF THE VEHICLE IS JUST BARELY HELD ON TO THE CHASSIS, BY WHAT MEANS, I'M NOT SURE. EVERYTHING IS ROTTING OFF THE VEHICLE. EMERGENCY BRAKE CABLE, REAR FRAME AND FLOOR PAN HAS HOLES....LOOKS LIKE A FLINSTONE MOBILE.YOU CAN ALMOST LITERALLY DRIVE THE VEHICLE WITH YOUR FEET IN CERTAIN AREAS. THE FRONT SHOCKS ARE RUSTED THROUGH, AND THE BODY HAS HAD TO BE REPAIRED FOR RUST. THIS VEHICLE HAS CANCER, AND IT'S TERMINAL. I LIVE IN THE STATE OF MAINE WHERE YEARLY VEHICLE INSPECTION IS MANDATORY....THE TROOPER BARELY PASSED LAST YEAR. I HAVE PAID MONEY TO HAVE THIS VEHICLE RE-REGISTERED, AND INSURED (WHICH HERE IN MAINE PRECEEDS INSPECTION) AND NOW IT WON'T PASS INSPECTION. THIS IS AFTER DOING EXTENSIVE WORK TO IT....EVERY GARAGE TELLS ME THAT THE VEHICLE IS POORLY CONSTRUCTED/UNSAFE EVEN AFTER COSTLY REPAIRS/AND DON'T EVEN RECOMMEND THAT I SELL IT FOR FEAR THAT SOMEONE MAY HAVE A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT DUE TO THE FRAME DETERIORIZATION. THOUGH THIS VEHICLE IS ALMOST 14 YEARS OLD, IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF. THIS IS CLEARLY A MANUFACTURING PROBLEM  WHICH AFFECTS EVERY TROOPER THAT I HAVE SEEN. PLEASE ADVISE ME OF WHAT TO DO WITH THIS VEHICLE AS IT IS A HAZARD, AND FROM WHAT I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY SEVERAL GARAGES, CANNOT BE FIXED. PLEASE HELP ME WITH MY DILEMA, I WOULD BE VERY GRATEFUL.

PERHAPS THERE ALREADY HAS BEEN A RECALL ON THIS MAKE AND MODEL VEHICLE, WHICH IS A 32 FOOT MOTORHOME.  I DO NOT KNOW WHERE TO CHECK TO SEE IF THERE HAS ALREADY BEEN A RECALL.  IF YOU HAVE INFORMATION REGARDING SUCH, WOULD APPRECIATE YOU LETTING ME KNOW.  THIS PROBLEM NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.",WINNEBAGO,WINNEBAGO

I MAINTAIN MY TIRE PRESSURE AT 65PSI COLD VERY CAREFULLY AND THESE TIRES SHOWED NO LOSS OF PRESSURE BEFORE THE FAILURES. NO SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF CONTROL OCCURRED, BUT HUBCAPS AND TIRES WERE DESTROYED.  THEY WERE REPLACED WITH SIMILAR DIFFERENT BRAND TIRES.  *TR",WINNEBAGO,WINNEBAGO
