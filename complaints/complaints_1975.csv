731063,"General Motors, LLC",0,0,0,0,,09/11/2000,,TIRES,"IN 1975, MY FATHER BOUGHT THE SKYHAWK AS A SPECIAL ORDER.  WE HAD THE VEHICLE ABOUT 6 MONTHS WHEN, WHILE DRIVING DOWN INTERSTATE 495 IN MARYLAND, THE FRONT LEFT TIRE STARTED PEELING THE STEEL OF THE STEEL BELTED TIRE.  WE WERE FORTUNATE AT THAT TIME TO HEAR THE NOISE OF THE STEEL AGAINST THE WHEEL WELL, SO WE PULLED OVER ONTO THE SHOULDER.  WE WERE FORTUNATE TO HAVE A MD STATE TROOPER ASSIST US WITH THE SPARE (DONUT) TIRE.  WE CONTINUED THE DRIVE TO DELAWARE ON THE DONUT.  SEVERAL MONTHS AFTER THAT INCIDENT, THE REAR LEFT TIRE BLEW WHILE DRIVING ON INTERSTATE 395 AT SHIRLINGTON (ARLINGTON, VA) AT THE BASE OF THE FEED-IN RAMP.  SOON AFTER, THE RIGHT REAR STARTED SPLITTING STEEL, AT WHICH POINT MY FATHER HAD ALL THE TIRES REPLACED WITH GOODYEAR RATHER THAN CONTINUING TO GO BACK TO FIRESTONE AND GETTING A NEW TIRE AND CREDIT FOR THE DEFECTIVE ONE.  ALTHOUGH WE NO LONGER HAVE THE CAR (IT DIED), FIRESTONE HAD THE SAME OR SIMILAR PROBLEMS WITH THEIR TIRES IN 1975.  THE NEWS SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT THIS IS A FAIRLY NEW PROBLEM, BUT AS YOU CAN SEE FROM MY COMMENTS, THIS WAS HAPPENING 25 YEARS AGO, ONLY ON SUB-COMPACT CARS INSTEAD OF SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES.  ALTHOUGH MY DAD PASSED AWAY, I WAS WITH HIM FOR ALL 3 INCIDENTS, SO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE CALL ME.  THANKS AND HAVE A GOOD WEEK!!  *AK( DOT NUMBER:   )",BUICK,SKYHAWK

MY NASAL MUCOUS DISCHARGES WERE BLACK AND I ALSO EXPERIENCED CONTINUAL EXHAUSTION - OFTEN RESULTING IN MY BLACKING-OUT WHILE DRIVING. REPEATEDLY RETURNING THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP (JACK PERRY FORD ON NY RT. 17M IN GOSHEN NY) I WAS ADMONISHED BY BOTH THE SALES AND SERVICE STAFF WITH ""IT MUST BE ALL IN YOUR HEAD"".MY WORK AND COLLEGE STUDIES SUFFERED - EVENTUALLY LEADING TO MY BEING DISMISSED FOR POOR PERFORMANCE. THOUGH I WAS REINSTATED I STRUGGLED AND TODAY, WHILE ENROLLED (AGAIN) - I FIND I'VE BEEN DAMAGED PHYSICALLY, EMOTIONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY DUE TO WHAT WAS EVENTUALLY DISCOVERED TO BE A DELIBERATE DESIGN DEFECT IN THE CAR'S EXHAUST SYSTEM. UPON MY RETURN FROM ACTIVE DUTY IN THE USAF, HAVING LEFT THE CAR ON BLOCKS, THE ORIGINAL EXHAUST SYSTEM HAD ROTTED-OUT. I TOOK IT TO A MEINEKE DEALERSHIP IN NEWBURGH NY WHERE THE OWNER INSTALLED A 'STOCK' SYSTEM. HE WARNED ME I MIGHT BEGIN SUFFERING THE VERY SYMPTOMS LISTED ABOVE AND SHOWED ME WHY.  THE DUAL TAILPIPES TERMINATED APPROX 8 INCHES FORWARD OF THE REAR BUMPER. COMBINED WITH THE AERODYNAMICS OF THE UNDERCARRIAGE; THIS RESULTED IN EXHUAST GASES BEING TRAPPED UNDERNEATH AND LEAKING INTO THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT THROUGH THE VENTILATION SYSTEM AND WINDOWS - POSSIBLY AFFIXIATING ALL WITHIN. ACCORDING TO THE MEINEKE SHOP OWNER; FORD AND IOCCOCA PULLED THIS MODEL FROM PRODUCTION AFTER JUST 4 MONTHS FOLLOWING ITS INTRODUCTION. FORD REPRESENTATIVES AT VARIOUS NYC AUTO SHOWS DENY FORD EVER EVEN PRODUCED THIS PARTICULAR MODEL.
