THE LEFT REAR TREAD SEPARATED FROM THE CARCASS AT SPEED.  THE REMAINING 3 TIRES HAVE ON AVERAGE 5-6 MM OF TREAD REMAINING.  THE TIRE PRESSURE WAS CHECKED THE DAY BEFORE 53 PSI AND I INCREASED THE PRESSUE TO 60 TO MATCH THE OTHER TIRES.  THE VEHICLE WAS PARTIALLY LOADED WITH APX 600 LBS IN THE REAR.  THE TIRES WERE ORIGINAL EQUIPPMENT ""TAKE OFF"" TIRES AND RIMS FOR A 93 F250.  THE TIRES AND WHEELS WERE PURCHASED AS A MATCHED SET WITH LESS THAN 600 MILES WEAR, FROM A FORD DEALERSHIP IN LATE 93 OR EARLY 94.   I AM NATURALLY CONCERNED FOR MY SAFETY WITH THE REMAINING 3 FIRESTONE TIRES.  THE TIRE DEMONSTRATED NO BULGING, EDGE SEPARATION, ""THUMPING"" OR FLAT SPOTS PRIOR TO FAILURE.  THE TIRE DID SHOW SIGNS OF A SLOW LEAK WITH A LOSS OF 2-4 PSI  A MONTH WHEN SET AT 60 PSI.  REPEATED INSPECTIONS FOR NAILS, SCREWS, PUNCTURES OR SIDEWALL DAMAGE WERE NEGATIVE.   I ATTRIBUTED THE TIRE PRESSURE LOSS TO A BAD VALVE STEM.  THE WEAR PATTERN ON THE REMAINING TIRES IS CONSISTENT WITH NORMAL OPERATION.  I USE THE VEHICLE RECREATIONALY AND NOT FOR WORK.    PLEASE HELP, WHAT SHOULD I DO??? (DOT NUMBER: VNOR1WT103  TIRESIZE: LT23585R16)",CHEVROLET,C SERIES

I HAD A SHOP REPLACE THE ORIGINAL POWER STEERING BOX (RECIRCULATING BALL STEERING GEAR) WITH A NEW ONE FROM CLASSIC PERFORMANCE PRODUCTS (CPP).  THEIR WEB SITE WOULD LEAD YOU TO BELIEVE THEY MAKE EVERYTHING LOCALLY BUT THEY FINALLY ADMITTED THEIR 400 SERIES STEERING BOXES ARE MANUFACTURED OVERSEAS. I HAD A CERTIFIED MECHANIC DO ALL THE WORK AND HE HAD A LOT OF TROUBLE WITH THE INSTALLATION.  FROM DAY ONE, THE BOX DID NOT PERFORM TO ANYONE'S EXPECTATIONS.  AT IDLE, IT PROVIDED NO POWER ASSIST AT ALL.  EVENTUALLY IT BEGAN TO STICK WHEN TURNING A CORNER AND FINALLY IT FAILED ALL TOGETHER RENDERING THE CAR INOPERABLE.  WHEN IT FAILED, IT WAS AS IF THE STEERING WHEEL WAS NO LONGER CONNECTED TO THE STEERING BOX.  I HAVE PICTURES OF THE INTERNALS OF THE BOX AFTER IT FAILED AND THE MECHANIC ADMITTED HE NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.  THE BOX WAS SENT BACK TO CPP AND THEY REPLACED IT WITH ANOTHER 400 SERIES BOX WHICH IS ALSO NOT PERFORMING CORRECTLY.  SOME OF THE STEEL BALLS WERE ELONGATED AND SOME WERE FLATTENED WHICH WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE IF THEY WERE MADE FROM HIGH GRADE HARDENED STEEL - THE KIND USA MANUFACTURERS TELL ME THEY USE.  ACCORDING TO CUSTOMER COMMENTS ON THEIR WEB SITE, I AM NOT THE ONLY CONSUMER WHO HAS EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM WITH THIS BOX.   THEIR ENGINEERING DEPT. EVEN OFFERS A WORK AROUND FOR SOME OF THE PROBLEMS SO I BELIEVE THEY ARE AWARE OF THESE PROBLEMS YET THEY CONTINUE TO SELL THE PRODUCT.  I HESITATE TO THINK WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THE FAILURE HAD OCCURRED WHILE DRIVING ON AN INTERSTATE EXPRESSWAY AT 60 MPH.  I DO NOT KNOW IF CPP AS A COMPANY IS ACTING IRRESPONSIBLY BUT I CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE SOME HELP PREVENTING ANY MORE OF THESE BOXES BEING SOLD UNTIL THIS PROBLEM IS FULLY RESOLVED.  ANYONE WHO OWNS ONE OF THEIR BOXES SHOULD BE MADE AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL DANGER.  PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT CAN BE DONE.  *TR",CHEVROLET,CAMARO

ON 4/10/07 I PURCHASED ANOTHER 3 OF THE  SAME TIRES, INCLUDING VALVES, AT SEARS AT 95668 MILES ODOMETER READING AND HAD THE TIRES, INCLUDING THE EARLIER PURCHASED SPARE, MOUNTED ON MY CAR.  ON 11/14/07 WHILE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY, MY LEFT FRONT TIRE BLEW OUT AND I DISCOVERED THAT THE VALVE WAS CRACKED AT THE BASE. THE  SAME DAY I PAID SEARS TO REPLACE THE VALVE. THE ODOMETER READING WAS 96382.  ON 7/4/09 I DISCOVERED THAT THE RIGHT FRONT TIRE LOST ALL AIR WHILE SITTING IN THE GARAGE WITH AN ODOMETER READING OF 97561. AN INSPECTION OF THE VALVE REVEALED THAT IT TOO WAS CRACKED. NOTE THAT I DRIVE THIS CARE VERY LITTLE AND MOSTLY IN THE CITY. THE VALVE STEMS DO NOT STICK OUT OF THE WHEEL COVERS AND COULD NOT HAVE BEEN DAMAGED FROM PARKING. NOW I HAVE TO CONVINCE SEARS TO TAKE ALL WHEELS OFF AND INSPECT AND REPLACE ALL VALVES BEFORE AN ACCIDENT HAPPENS. AND I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR IT.
