THE LEFT REAR TREAD SEPARATED FROM THE CARCASS AT SPEED.  THE REMAINING 3 TIRES HAVE ON AVERAGE 5-6 MM OF TREAD REMAINING.  THE TIRE PRESSURE WAS CHECKED THE DAY BEFORE 53 PSI AND I INCREASED THE PRESSUE TO 60 TO MATCH THE OTHER TIRES.  THE VEHICLE WAS PARTIALLY LOADED WITH APX 600 LBS IN THE REAR.  THE TIRES WERE ORIGINAL EQUIPPMENT ""TAKE OFF"" TIRES AND RIMS FOR A 93 F250.  THE TIRES AND WHEELS WERE PURCHASED AS A MATCHED SET WITH LESS THAN 600 MILES WEAR, FROM A FORD DEALERSHIP IN LATE 93 OR EARLY 94.   I AM NATURALLY CONCERNED FOR MY SAFETY WITH THE REMAINING 3 FIRESTONE TIRES.  THE TIRE DEMONSTRATED NO BULGING, EDGE SEPARATION, ""THUMPING"" OR FLAT SPOTS PRIOR TO FAILURE.  THE TIRE DID SHOW SIGNS OF A SLOW LEAK WITH A LOSS OF 2-4 PSI  A MONTH WHEN SET AT 60 PSI.  REPEATED INSPECTIONS FOR NAILS, SCREWS, PUNCTURES OR SIDEWALL DAMAGE WERE NEGATIVE.

I HAD A SHOP REPLACE THE ORIGINAL POWER STEERING BOX (RECIRCULATING BALL STEERING GEAR) WITH A NEW ONE FROM CLASSIC PERFORMANCE PRODUCTS (CPP).  THEIR WEB SITE WOULD LEAD YOU TO BELIEVE THEY MAKE EVERYTHING LOCALLY BUT THEY FINALLY ADMITTED THEIR 400 SERIES STEERING BOXES ARE MANUFACTURED OVERSEAS. I HAD A CERTIFIED MECHANIC DO ALL THE WORK AND HE HAD A LOT OF TROUBLE WITH THE INSTALLATION.  FROM DAY ONE, THE BOX DID NOT PERFORM TO ANYONE'S EXPECTATIONS.  AT IDLE, IT PROVIDED NO POWER ASSIST AT ALL.  EVENTUALLY IT BEGAN TO STICK WHEN TURNING A CORNER AND FINALLY IT FAILED ALL TOGETHER RENDERING THE CAR INOPERABLE.  WHEN IT FAILED, IT WAS AS IF THE STEERING WHEEL WAS NO LONGER CONNECTED TO THE STEERING BOX.  I HAVE PICTURES OF THE INTERNALS OF THE BOX AFTER IT FAILED AND THE MECHANIC ADMITTED HE NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.  THE BOX WAS SENT BACK TO CPP AND THEY REPLACED IT WITH ANOTHER 400 SERIES BOX WHICH IS ALSO NOT PERFORMING CORRECTLY.  SOME OF THE STEEL BALLS WERE ELONGATED AND SOME WERE FLATTENED WHICH WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE IF THEY WERE MADE FROM HIGH GRADE HARDENED STEEL - THE KIND USA MANUFACTURERS TELL ME THEY USE.  ACCORDING TO CUSTOMER COMMENTS ON THEIR WEB SITE, I AM NOT THE ONLY CONSUMER WHO HAS EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM WITH THIS BOX.   THEIR ENGINEERING DEPT. EVEN OFFERS A WORK AROUND FOR SOME OF THE PROBLEMS SO I BELIEVE THEY ARE AWARE OF THESE PROBLEMS YET THEY CONTINUE TO SELL THE PRODUCT.  I HESITATE TO THINK WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THE FAILURE HAD OCCURRED WHILE DRIVING ON AN INTERSTATE EXPRESSWAY AT 60 MPH.  I DO NOT KNOW IF CPP AS A COMPANY IS ACTING IRRESPONSIBLY BUT I CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE SOME HELP PREVENTING ANY MORE OF THESE BOXES BEING SOLD UNTIL THIS PROBLEM IS FULLY RESOLVED.

IT HAS BEEN APPROX. 3 WEEKS SINCE I HAD ALL THE RECALL WORK DONE AND WHILE DRIVING HOME FROM FLA. I WENT INTO A GAS STATION TO PUT AIR IN MY TIRES AND THEN ALL [XXX] BROKE LOOSE.  I WAS DRIVING SLOW LOOKING FOR THE AIR PUMP AND THE CARWENT CRAZY ACCELERATING.  I YELLED, PUT MY FOOT ON THE BRAKES AND TURNED OFF THE MOTOR.  IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FLOOR MAT, PEDAL ETC.  NOTHING WAS NOTICEABLE STUCK.  I LOVE THIS CAR, BUT THERE IS A DEVIL INSIDE THE MOTOR.  SINCE THE RECALL DID NOT TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM WHAT SHOULD I DO?

NEVERTHELESS, THEY CHARGED $1150 FOR TWO HEADLIGHTS WHICH CANNOT BE BOUGHT ANYWHERE EXCEPT THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP.  THEY WERE ONLY 2 YEARS OLD.

TOYOTA ISSUED A SERVICE BULLETIN RECALL FOR THIS DEFECT IN 2005. THE PROBLEM 1ST APPEARED IN MY CAR IN MARCH 2007. THE FOLSOM LAKE TOYOTA DEALER REPAIRED MY VEHICLE BY SENDING IT OUT TO A WELDING COMPANY TO BE REPAIRED. I WAS PROVIDED WITH A RENTAL CAR AT NO CHARGE BY TOYOTA. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE DEFECT, AS STATED ON THE REPAIR SLIP IS AS FOLLOWS: ""...FOUND DOOR DEFORMED AND WELD BROKEN INSIDE DOOR , 23 REPLACED DRIVERS DOOR CHECK, SUBLET TO BODY SHOP FOR REPAIR OF DOOR.""  I HAVE A COPY OF THIS ORIGINAL REPAIR FORM. THE 2ND TIME THIS DEFECT RE-APPEARED WAS ON JULY 8, 2010. I IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THE PROBLEM TO TOYOTA CORPORATE, WAS ASSIGNED CASE # 1007081422 AND WAS ADVISED BY THE TOYOTA CORPORATE REPRESENTATIVE THAT THE TOYOTA OF RICHMOND, INDIANA DEALER WOULD BE CALLING ME WITHIN 3 DAYS TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT TO BRING MY CAR IN AND RECEIVE A FREE RENTAL UNTIL MY CAR'S DEFORMITIES WERE FIXED. THE DEALER FAILED TO RESPOND WITHIN 3 DAYS, AND I CALLED CORPORATE AGAIN ON 7-14-10 AND SPOKE WITH CATHERINE. SHE SENT ANOTHER REQUEST TO TOYOTA OF RICHMOND AND SAID THAT I WOULD HEAR FROM THE DEALER WITHIN 24 HRS. AGAIN, TOYOTA OF RICHMOND FAILED TO CONTACT ME. I CALLED TOYOTA CORPORATE MOMENTS AGO (7-16-10), AND JESSIE SAID THEY HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THEIR DEALERS FIXING TOYOTA DEFECTS AND THAT I SHOULD TRY TO CONTACT THEM MYSELF. TOYOTA HAS A LEGAL AND ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITY TO FIX THEIR KNOWN DEFECTIVE PROBLEMS. AFTER ALL OF THESE FAILED ATTEMPTS TO GET RICHMOND TOYOTA TO CONTACT ME TO INITIATE  THE REPAIR PROCESS, TOYOTA SHOULD BE FINED AND/OR TOYOTA SHOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM SELLING IN THE US MARKETPLACE.

BEFORE ENTERING THE STREET THE CAR  HAS TO BE STOPPED, HOWEVER, WITHOUT PRESSING THE  GAS PEDAL, THE CAR ON ITS OWN ACCELERATED.  IMMEDIATELY I APPLIED THE BRAKES, BUT THE CAR DID NOT RESPOND. THE CAR SPEEDED INTO A GRASSY AREA, AND FROM THERE  TO OUR OVERFLOW PARKING LOT, AND FROM THERE TO A SECOND PARKING LOT. THE TIRES BURNED THE GRASS DUE TO THE APPLIED BRAKES. PICTURE OF THE BURNED GRASS CAN BE SUPPLIED IF REQUESTED. THE UNSTOPPABLE CAR TRAVELED ABOUT 170 YARDS. DUE TO THE FORCE BY WHICH THE CAR HIT FOUR CURVES, THE FRONT TIRES WERE FLATTENED AND THE FRONT RIGHT WHEEL WAS SEVERELY DAMAGED. THE FRONT END COLLAPSED TO THE GROUND AND THE CAR FINALLY STOPPED. MY WIFE  AND MYSELF WERE WEARING THE SAFETY BELTS, WHICH PREVENTED TO BE THROWN INTO THE FRONT WINDSHIELD..MY WIFE WAS SITTING NEXT TO ME, THERE WERE NO OTHER PASSENGERS IN THE CAR. IN ADDITION THE FORCE CAUSED BOTH OF THE FRONT AIRBAGS TO DEPLOY. MINIMIZING THE HUMAN DAMAGE. THE AIRBAGS CAUSED A SECOND DEGREE BURN ON MY LEFT ARM AS  DETERMINED IN THE ER.  THE AIRBAG ALSO HIT THE FRONT OF MY  FACE. AND SLIGHTLY BURNED THE FINGER ON HER LEFT HAND. NEEDLESS TO STAY THAT WE WERE EXTREMELY SHAKEN AND FRIGHTENED. UPON EXITING THE CAR I CALLED 911 AND REPORTED WHAT HAPPENED. AN UNKNOWN  NEIGHBOR CALLED AN AMBULANCE, WHICH CAME VERY SOON WITH A LARGE FIRE TRUCK. WE WERE TAKEN TO THE  ER OF A LOCAL HOSPITAL. WE SPENT AT 4-5 HOURS IN THE ER OF THE HOSPITAL WHERE WE WERE X-RAYED. EVEN AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, SOME 2 MONTHS AFTER THE ACCIDENT BOTH MY WIFE AND I REMAIN EXTREMELY SHAKEN BY THIS TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE. MY WIFE'S SPINAL PROBLEMS WERE ENHANCED BY THE CRASH, AND HER CONDITION IS BEING MONITORED BY SPECIALISTS. THE CAR WAS NOT ON THE RECALL LIST..
