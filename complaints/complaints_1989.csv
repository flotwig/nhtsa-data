THE SERVICE ADVISOR (DICK SMITH I THINK HIS NAME IS) ASSURED ME THAT SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE WOULD ADDRESS THE ENGINE SURGE PROBLEM AND AS I THINK ABOUT IT I AGREED TO IT BECAUSE THAT WAS AT LEAST THE SECOND TIME I WAS IN LINDSAY CADILLAC FOR SERVICE ON THE ENGINE SURGE.  I RETURNED A FEW DAYS LATER AS MY SCHEDULED ALLOWED AND RECALL TALKING WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER WHO REFUSED TO ADMIT THAT THE FIRST 3 TIMES I WAS THERE, THOSE CADILLAC ""EXPERTS"" SHOULD HAVE FIXED IT PROPERLY THE FIRST TIME AND AT THE MOST BEFORE THE 3RD VISIT.  OF COURSE ""DICK"" ASSURED HIS BOSS THAT HE SAID NOTHING OF THE SORT (THAT $495 SHCEDULED MAINTENANCE WOULD ONCE AND FOR ALL SOLVE THE ENGINE SURGE).  I CAME SO CLOSE TO REARENDING MAYBE FIVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE DURING THAT WHOLE RUNAROUND PERIOD.  FINALLY, WITH MY LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF VEHICLES, I REDUCED THE IDLE CONTROL SO THE HIGH REVING ENGINE WOULDN'T DO DAMAGE UNTIL I FOUND A SOLUTION TO THIS.  AND NOW I COME ACROSS YOUR WEBSITE AND SEE SOME OF THE SAME COMPLAINTS I MADE TO LINDSAY CADILLAC OF ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA IN A LIST OF RECALLS AND TSB'S THAT WERE ISSUED 2 YEARS AFTER THEY (LINDSAY) SOLD THIS CAR TO THE PREVIOUS OWNER NAMED TIPTON ACCORDING TO DICK SMITH IN SUMMER OF 1989.  OF THE 253 COMPLAINTS ON THE 1989 CADILLAC DEVILLE THAT I FIND IN YOUR COMPLAINTS DATABASE, 29 OF THEM CITE A PROBLEM WITH THE THROTTLE.  THAT IS A CONSIDERABLE PERCENTAGE CONSIDERING THAT SILENT SUFFERS (THOSE WHO WON'T MAKE OFFICIAL COMPLAINTS BUT WILL BUY IMPORTS INSTEAD) COULD COUNT FOR A ESTIMATED ADDITIONAL 30%.  IT IS NO WONDER THAT IMPORT AUTOMAKERS ADVERTISE LESS THAN ""DAMS"" (DOMESTIC AUTO MAKER S) DAMS ARE THE SINGLE BEST REASON FOR BUYING UNAMERICAN.                  NOW, WITH THE SIGNIFICANT % OF REPORTED COMPLAINTS ON THE THROTTLE OF THE 1989 CADILLAC DEVILLE, SHOULDN'T A RECALL BE IN ORDER?

SINCE MANY THOUSANDS OF THESE SYSTEMS ARE IN USE, IT IS OF CONCERN THAT VEHICLES USING THIS TYPE SYSTEM ARE UNSAFE FOR RESALE. OWNERS MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW THEY HAVE WEAKENED THE FIREWALL OF THE VEHICLE BY USING AN EXTREME BRAKE PEDAL PRESSURE DEVICE WHILE TOWING. ARE THE BRAKES OF A VEHICLE DESIGNED TO WORK WITH THE POWER ASSIST INACTIVE FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME, WITHOUT CAUSING STRUCTURAL DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE BRAKING COMPONENTS? IS THIS NOT MEANT TO BE AN EMERGENCY APPLICATION MEASURE ONLY? SHOULD THE SELLER OF A VEHICLE USING THIS TYPE EXTREME PRESSURE METHOD TELL THE PROSPECTIVE BUYER THAT THE VEHICLE HAS USED A DEVICE LIKE THIS, WHICH CAUSES STRUCTURAL STRESSES WAY BEYOND THE ORIGINAL MANUFACTURERS INTENDED USE? THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF DRIVERS USING DEVICES LIKE THIS, MANUFACTURED BY SEVERAL COMPANIES IN THE RV INDUSTRY. BECAUSE THERE IS NO REGULATION FOR THE BRAKING OF A VEHICLE TOWED WITH FOUR WHEELS DOWN, MANY DRIVERS ARE LEFT TO USE WHAT IS PRESENTED TO THEM BY AFTERMARKET MANUFACTURERS.

MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF CURRENT PASSED FROM THE BATTERY THROUGH THE ALTERNATOR, WHICH BURST INTO FLAMES.  THE FAULT CAUSED THE ENGINE TO STALL DUE TO LACK OF IGNITION AND IT WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO STEER AND STOP THE VEHICLE AS A RESULT OF LOSS OF POWER STEERING AND POWER BRAKES. SMOKE WAS POURING FROM THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE. WHEN I MANAGED TO STOP AND OPEN THE HOOD, THE ALTERNATOR, WHICH WAS GLOWING RED INSIDE, BURST INTO FLAMES AND SET FIRE TO CABLES AND RUBBER HOSES AROUND IT. I RECEIVED BURNS TO MY HANDS TRYING TO PUT THE FIRE OUT. LUCKY FOR ME ANOTHER MOTORIST STOPPED AND HE HAD AN EXTINGUISHER. I HAVE NOW HAD TWO FIRES OF THIS TYPE, ONE ON EACH OF MY VEHICLES. YESTERDAY I WENT TO AN ALTERNATOR REMANUFACTURING COMPANY HERE IN MONTERREY, AND THE MANGER TOLD ME THAT HE HAS HAD FIVE ENGINE BAY FIRES IN AEROSTAR MINIVANS IN RECENT MONTHS. IN THE 'GOOD OLD DAYS'  UNDERSTAND THERE WAS A FUSIBLE LINK BETWEEN THE ALTERNATOR CHARGING LINE AND THE BATTERY + TERMINAL. THERE SHOULD BE A FUSE IN THIS CIRCUIT BECAUSE IT IS CONNECTED DIRECTLY TO THE BATTERY!! NOT ONLY IS THE FIRE A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM, BUT THERE IS A SERIOUS RISK IN THE EVENT OF THIS FAULT, THAT THE OVERLOAD ON THE BATTERY WILL CAUSE IT TO BURST, SHOWERING EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE AROUND IT WITH HOT SULFURIC ACID.

I LOST TRACTION ON THE WHEEL AND THE VEHICLE BECAME HARD TO CONTROL AS IT WHEN OFF THE ROAD.  I WAS ABLE TO STOP THE BRONCO  AND CHANGE THE TIRE AND CONTINUE DRIVING.  THE SECOND FAILURE OCCURRED WHEN MY WIFE WAS DRIVING ON THE LEFT REAR A WEEK LATER ON I-4 AT 65 MILES PER HOUR,  THE TIRE SEPARATED AND DEFLATED AND CAUSED ABOUT $500.00  DAMAGE TO THE LEFT REAR QUARTER PANEL.  THE NEXT WEEK  ON I-75 THE VEHICLE BECAME UNSTABLE AND HARD TO CONTROL I STOPPED THE BRONCO AND FOUND THE RIGHT LEFT REAR TIRE WAS STARTING TO SEPARATE AND CHANGED TO TIRE OUT.  I ASKED MY FIRESTONE DEALER AT THAT TIME WHAT THEY THOUGHT THE PROBLEM WAS WITH THE TIRES AND WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS PROBABLY THE AGE OF THE TIRES.  I REPLACED ALL THE TIRES ON THE BRONCO AND KEPT ONE OF THE OLD ATX TIRES AS A SPARE ON 08/13/1998.( DOT NUMBER: VD60AT4493 TIRE SIZE: 31X1050R15 )",FORD,BRONCO

THE POSITIVE LEAD ON THE BATTERY IS CONNECTED TO THE BATTERY ON THE SIDE OF THE BATTERY THAT IS DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO THE FENDER ON THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE.  THESE TWO DESIGN FLAWS WORK TOGETHER TO CAUSE A SITUATION WHICH CAN EASILY CAUSE A FIRE IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT OF THE VEHICLE.   IN MY PARTICULAR CASE, WHICH SHOULD BE VERY TYPICAL, THE BATTERY HOLD DOWN BRACKET DID NOT HOLD THE BATTERY IN PLACE.  DUE TO THIS PROBLEM, THE BATTERY SHIFTED JUST A FEW INCHES TOWARD THE FENDER ON THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE. THIS CAUSED  THE POSITIVE TERMINAL OF THE BATTERY TO COME IN CONTACT WITH THE FENDER, THUS CAUSING THE BATTERY TO ""SHORT TO GROUND"".   THE RESULT OF THIS OCCURANCE WAS THAT MY ENTIRE WIRING HARNESS WAS SHORTED, BURNED AND DESTROYED.  THE CABLES THAT RELEASE MY EMERGENCY BRAKE AND HOOD WERE SHORTED AND THE EXTERIOR COATING BEGAN TO BURN.

I FIGURED IT WAS DUE TO A LEAK IN THE FUEL FILLER NECK AND STOPPED USING THE REAR TANK FOR THE NEXT 5 OR 6 YEARS ONCE BURNING OUT ALL THE FUEL.  A FEW MONTHS AGO I DECIDED TO GET A FEW THINGS FIXED ON THE TRUCK AND ASKED THE MECHANIC TO SEE IF HE COULD ISOLATE THE LEAK IN THE REAR TANK. SURPRISINGLY AFTER DOING A PRESSURE AND SMOKE CHECK, HE FOUND NO LEAK AND RECOMMENDED I PUT A FEW GALLONS IN AND SEE HOW THE TRUCK RAN.  THE TRUCK RAN FINE FOR A FEW WEEKS BUT, WHILE RUNNING ON THE FRONT TANK, I HAD SOME HESITATION PROBLEMS AND TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE SHOP.  THE MECHANIC CLEANED THE FUEL INJECTORS AND CHANGED THE FUEL PUMP IN THE REAR TANK (BASED ON A LOW PRESSURE READING) IN ORDER TO TRY TO ISOLATE THE PROBLEM POSSIBLY TO ONE OF THE TANKS.  HE ALSO CHANGED THE FUEL QUANTITY SENSOR SINCE IS HAD FAILED YEARS AGO.  I FILLED THE REAR TANK (18 GALLONS TOTAL) AND AFTER DRIVING A 30-MILE ROUND TRIP FOR SOME CHRISTMAS SHOPPING, NOTICED THE REAR FUEL GAUGE ONLY SHOWED 3/8 OF A TANK.  I FIGURED I HAD RECEIVED A BAD FUEL SENSOR AND DECIDED TO FILL THE TANK TO MAKE SURE.  THE TRUCK TOOK A TOTAL OF 7.5 GALLONS OF FUEL.  SINCE AT NO TIME DID I NOTE ANY FUEL LEAKAGE, I FIGURED THE FUEL HAS FLOWED TO THE FRONT TANK.

I WONDER IF THERE ARE ANY RECORDS ON OTHER PEOPLE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH TRANSMISSIONS , POWER TRAINS ON THESE TRUCKS.  WE JUST HOPE IT WILL HOLD TOGETHER UNTIL WE CAN AFFORD TO TRADE IT OFF.  WE HAVE ALSO HAD BRAKE PROBLEMS WITH THE TRUCK BUT THE MAJOR PROBLEM IS IT IS BREAKING US UP TO KEEP CLUTCHES IN IT.  WE DO NOT USE THE TRUCK EVERYDAY - IT USUALLY SITS IN THE DRIVEWAY.  THE DEALER DOES NOT SEEM CONCERNED ABOUT THIS PROBLEM - THEY DID NOT OFFER ANY HELP OTHER THAN TAKING OUR $2200.00 AND THEN TELLING US ""TOUGH LUCK"" WHEN THE CLUTCH WENT OUT AGAIN.  NEEDLESS TO SAY I WILL NEVER OWN ANOTHER FORD PRODUCT.",FORD,F250

FOR YEARS, I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH MY 1989 HONDA ACCORD.  SINCE THE FIRST YEAR OF OWNERSHIP THE CAR OVERHEATED AND REVVED VERY HIGH WHENEVER I HAD TO WAIT IN TRAFFIC FOR MORE THAN 15 MINUTES ON A 70 DEGREE OR HIGHER DAYS.  I'VE TAKEN THE CAR TO SEVERAL REPAIR FACILITIES AND DESPITE MY SPENDING NEARLY $3,000 ON ""REPAIR-WORK"", THE PROBLEM CAUSED THE CAR'S DEMISE AT 116,000 MILES ON JUNE 11, 2003.  THE GEAR WOULD NOT ENGAGE DESPITE CLUTCH REPLACEMENTS  IN JAN OR FEB. 2003 AND  IN 1999. I HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED HOME.  I HAVE TAKEN VERY GOOD CARE OF MY CAR, WITH REGULAR OIL CHANGES EVERY 3 TO 6 MONTHS HOPING TO KEEP IT TILL AN ODOMETER READING OF AT LEAST 160,000 MILES.  THIS PROBLEM STARTED WITHIN A YEAR OF OWNERSHIP AND I FELT THAT I HAD NO RECOURSE BUT TO TRY TO GET IT REPAIRED.  I DID NOT TAKE IT TO MY HONDA DEALER BECAUSE I FELT THAT THEIR CHARGES FOR OIL CHANGES WERE EXCESSIVE COMPARED TO REGULAR GAS STATIONS CHARGES AND TO MY MIND, DELIVERED INEFFECTUAL REPAIRS AND SUSPECT SUGGESTIONS FOR REPAIR AS WAS THE PRACTICE IN OTHER DEALERSHIPS IN THE EARLY 90'S.   MY HONDA EXPERIENCE WAS NOT A GOOD ONE AND HAS COST ME HALF THE PRICE OF THE CAR IN REPAIRS.  I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEEK ANY REDRESS FOR ME SINCE I PURCHASED THE CAR SO LONG AGO BUT I THINK I'VE BEEN DEALT A BAD DEAL.  THINKING BACK ON IT ALL, I BELIEVE I WAS SOLD A LEMON.  I DIDN'T THINK THIS WAS POSSIBLE IN A HONDA BUT WHEN I READ THE COMPLAINTS SECTION OF THIS WEBSITE, MANY OF THEN TO DO WITH ENGINE COOLING PROBLEMS, MY FAITH IN HONDA IS QUESTIONABLE.

THIS HAPPENS WHEN THE CLUTCH IS DEPRESSED FOR A STOP. THE CAR SEEMS TO PICK BUSY INTERSECTIONS TO STALL. THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE AC DELCO ECU USED IN THIS CAR. AC DELCO USED AN INSULATIVE SPRAY ON THE CIRCUIT BOARDS WHICH SHRINKS OVER TIME WHEN EXPOSED TO WARM AND COLD TEMPS.

MY COMPLAINT WAS REGARDING AN ELECTRICAL MELTDOWN THAT OCCURRED ON THE 1989 560 SEL W126 LAST FRIDAY. I RECENTLY BOUGHT  A SECOND CAR AND NOTICED THAT THE ENGINE HAD A LUMP OR A SURGE AT IDLE AND AT OPERATING SPEED. I THOUGHT SINCE THE CAR SAT FOR A WHILE BEFORE I BOUGHT IT THE PROBLEM WAS FUEL RELATED. I TOOK THE CAR  TO  REPAIR SHOP   FOR A NEW FUEL FILTER. TWO DAYS AFTER I BOUGHT IT THE CAR WAS RETURNED AND IT WAS RUNNING FINE UNTIL I STARTED GETTING THE LUMPY IDLE AND SURGE AT SPEED. MY MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT THE CAR NEEDED TO BE DRIVEN. I DID JUST THAT, AND TOOK THE CAR ON THE HIGHWAY WHICH DID NOT CURE THE PROBLEM. I NOTICED THAT WHILE I WAS DRIVING THE CAR SEEMED TO BLACK  OUT TEMPORARILY, CUTTING IGNITION AND FUEL, BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS A FLUKE AND CONTINUED DRIVING. WHEN MAKING A TURN LATER INTO THE GAS STATION THE CAR BLACKED OUT COMPLETELY AND SMOKE EMERGED FROM THE RIGHT FRONT OF THE CAR. I OPENED THE HOOD AND THE WIRING WAS ON FIRE. I IMMEDIATELY PUT OUT THE BLAZE AND HAD THE CAR TAKEN BACK TO THE REPAIR SHOP. AS OF NOW MY MECHANIC WAS GETTING A WIRING DIAGRAM OF THE CAR, AND WILL BE INVESTIGATING WHAT HAPPENED SO I COULD  REPORT THIS TO MY INSURANCE COMPANY. I AM NOT SURE WHAT THE CAUSE E WAS, BUT WE  WERE LEANING TOWARD A FAULTY WIRING HARNESS.  ALTHOUGH  IT HAD OVER 150,000 MILES, I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN. ONE WOULD  AN ENGINE OR TRANSMISSION PROBLEM, BUT NOT SOMETHING LIKE THIS. IF I WERE ON THE INTERSTATE, WHERE I WAS DRIVING PRIOR TO THE FIRE, I COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED, AND I COULD HAVE LOST THE CAR ALTOGETHER.  I AM NOT SURE IF STATE FARM WILL COVER THIS, BUT I PLAN TO USE THIS DATA WHEN TALKING TO THE CLAIM REPRESENTATIVE SHOULD I NEED TO FILE A CLAIM, WHICH I WILL KNOW AFTER SEEING AN ESTIMATE OF THE REPAIRS.  *AK",MERCEDES BENZ,560

I WAS ON A MAIN HIGHWAY.  INSTANTLY, I LOST POWER STEERING AND HAD TO PUT BOTH HANDS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE STEERING WHEEL IN ORDER TO TURN THE VEHICLE OFF OF THE ROAD.  I WALKED BACK TO LOOK FOR ANY METAL ON THE ROADWAY; SAW NONE.  WHEN I LOOKED UNDER THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE, I SAW THE PULLEY HANGING DOWN AT AN ANGLE FROM THE FRONT OF THE CRANKCASE; THE BELT WAS STILL LOOPED AROUND IT.  ON CLOSER INSPECTION, I DISCOVERED THE PULLEY HAD BROKEN AWAY FROM THE CRANKCASE CENTER BOLT.  I MANAGED TO DRIVE THE MONTERO 35 MILES BACK TO YAKIMA.  I WAS USING STRICTLY BATTERY POWER; THE ALTERNATOR WAS NOT CHARGING BECAUSE THE BELT WAS LOOSE.  ON MONDAY MORNING, NOV. 7, 2000, I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE IT TWO MILES TO CAREY MOTORS IN YAKIMA (TEL. 1-800-967-8242/509-457-3133).  THE SERVICE MANAGER IS TOM SMYER.  THEY DISCOVERED THAT THE CRANKSHAFT CENTER BOLT HAD CORRODED WITHIN THE CRANKSHAFT AND BROKE OFF.  TOM SAID HE HAD ANOTHER MONTERO PREVIOUSLY IN HIS SHOP WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  THEY SPENT FIVE HOURS TRYING TO REMOVE THE PIECE OF THE BOLT STILL IN THE CRANKSHAFT WITHOUT SUCCESS.  THE RESULT: THE CRANKSHAFT HAD TO BE REPLACED.  WITH ALL OF THE LABOR AND SUPPORTING HARDWARE, IT COST ME $3,500.  DURING THE REPAIR, THEY DISCOVERED A BROKEN ENGINE MOUNT ALSO.  THEY REPAIR IT.  TOM SAID THE REGIONAL MITSUBISHI DISTRICT PARTS AND SERVICE MANAGER, CRISTO NICOLAIDIS, TOLD HIM THAT MITSUBISHI WAS CONTEMPLATING A RECALL ON MONTEROS BECAUSE OF THE CRANKSHAFT BOLT PROBLEM AND THAT IF IT HAPPENED, THE 1989 MODELS WOULD ""PROBABLY"" BE INCLUDED AND I WOULD BE REIMBURSED THE REPAIR COSTS ON MY VEHICLE.  WHEN I ARRIVED BACK IN SPARKS, NV, WHERE I RESIDE, I FILED A REPORT WITH MITSUBISHI'S REGIONAL OFFICE IN SOUTHERN CALIF.  I BELIEVE THAT IF A SMALL PERSON DRIVING A MONTERO EXPERIENCES THIS CRANKSHAFT BOLT FAILURE, ESPECIALLY ON AN ICY ROAD, COULD RESULT IN COMPLETE LOSS OF CONTROL.",MITSUBISHI,MITSUBISHI

APPROXIMATELY 5 YEARS AFTER THE PURCHASE, IN OUR HOT SUMMERS, I NOTICED THE DIGITAL DASHBOARD (ONE OF THE FEATURES THAT ATTRACTED MY HUSBAND AND MYSELF TO THIS PARTICULAR CAR) STARTED SHOWING HORIZONTAL ""STREAKS"" ACROSS THE LIGHT PANEL & THE READINGS WOULD FLICKER IN AND OUT. AS THE YEARS PASSED, THE PROBLEM GREW WORSE, TO THE POINT WHERE THE LIGHTS WOULD ACTUALLY GO OUT COMPLETELY! WHEN THE PROBLEM FIRST STARTED, APPROXIMATELY 1994, I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP IT WAS PURCHASED FROM AND WAS INFORMED THAT, YES, THEY HAD DISCONTINUED USING THESE DIGITAL LIGHTS JUST FOR THAT REASON! UPON INQUIRY TO REPAIR, I WAS TOLD THE CAR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AND IT WOULD COST ROUGHLY (AT THAT TIME) $1200 - $1400 TO INSTALL THE ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS REQUIRED TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM!!! I HAD THEM SOMETIMES. I AM STILL DRIVING THE CAR AFTER 15 YRS., I NEVER HAVE ANY OF MY DASH LIGHTS - NOT SPEED, OIL, GAS, MILEAGE, CHECK ENGINE, CRUISE CONTROL OR TEMPERATURE; OR ANY OTHER READINGS I'VE LONG FORGOTTEN HAD BEEN THERE. OBVIOUSLY, SPEED AND MY GAS GAUGE ARE THE TWO THINGS I CONSIDER MISSING THE MOST. I CAN KEEP UP WITH THE GAS, I'VE ONLY RUN OUT ONCE, TO MY CREDIT. THE SPEED, HOWEVER, I FEEL IS DANGEROUS. PERHAPS NISSAN DOES NOT CARE IF I GET A TICKET OR TWO FOR BEING OVER THE SPEED LIMIT, SO PERHAPS THAT DANGER IS PERCEIVED AS ""ONLY TO ME"", AFTERALL, IT'S NOT LIKE THE BRAKES OR TRANSMISSION. I DO NOT AGREE. I HAVE FELT, FROM THE BEGINNING, THAT TO FIX THIS PROBLEM IS NISSAN'S RESPONSIBILITY.  I KNOW THERE ARE OTHER 1989 MAXIMAS ON THE ROAD WITH NO DASH LIGHTS. I HAVE BEEN ""IN THE DARK"" FOR ABOUT 8 YRS. NOW AND I DO FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE. THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING THIS FORUM TO EXPLAIN THIS CAR'S PROBLEM, I DID WRITE TO NISSAN CORP.

WHEN IT HAPPENED A SECOND TIME, I BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE DEALER AND TOLD THEM TO KEEP THE CAR; DRIVE IT AND SEE FOR THEMSELVES.  FORTUNATELY, THIS PROBLEM DID HAPPEN TO ONE OF THEIR MECHANICS (HE WAS GOING AROUND A CURVE AT 35 MPH) AND HE LIVED TO TELL ABOUT IT.

EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, ESPECIALLY WHEN ICY AND RPMSAND APPROACHING REDLINE.  NOT A RARE PROBLEM IN MINNESOTA, WHERE IT IS OFTEN COLD, WITH 1988 AND 1989 JETTAS (WITH THE DIGIVOX SYSTEM).TEMPORARY FIX BY DIERCK'S REPAIR (BYRON,MN 507-775-2754).  VOLKSWAGEN USA CLAIMS NO KNOWLEDGE BUT DIERCK'S SEES SEVERAL EACH TIME IT GETS COLD. WHEN ENGINE IS COLD, WARM AIR FROM ENGINE IS BROUGHT INTO THE THROTTLE HOUSING, CAUSING CONDENSATION.WHEN THE ENGINE WARMS, INTAKE SWITCHES TO OUTSIDE AIR, WHICH IS VERY COLD, AND CAUSES THE WATER TO FREEZE, LEADING TO THROTTLE STICKING.  TEMPORARY FIX CONSISTS OF DISCONNECTING WARM AIR INTAKE IN COLD WEATHER AND PLUGGING PORTS.HOWEVER, THIS LEADS TO SOME EXHAUST COMING OFF THE ENGINE AND INTO PASSENGER COMPARTMENT. VERY PREDICTABLE PROBLEM AND PREVENTABLE IF VOLKSWAGEN WOULD PROVIDE FIX-IT KIT.  DIERCK'S REPAIR IS WILLING TO TALK ABOUT PROBLEM (ASK FOR BARD).  SUMMER DRIVING IS FINE. TAKES SOME TIME IN COLD WEATHER TO BUILD UP ENOUGH WATER IN THROTTLE HOUSING. COMBINE ENOUGH CONDENSATION OVER TIME AND THE PROBLEM WILL OCCUR (ONLY 1988 AND 1989). AS A SIDE NOTE-VOLKSWAGEN DEALER LOOKED FOR PROBLEM AND COULD NEVER PIN-POINT PROBLEM. THUS I WAS CHARGED FOR MANY USELESS REPAIRS.  DIERCK'S KNEW WHAT IT WAS OVER THE PHONE IMMEDIATELY AND EVEN ASKED IF IT WAS AN 88 OR 89 BEFORE I TOLD THEM THE YEAR.  THEY ARE AS FRUSTRATED AS I AM THAT SUCH A SIMPLE YET DANGEROUS PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED BY VOLKSWAGEN.  I WOULD BE WILLING TO TALK WITH ANYONE ABOUT THE PROBLEM.  THIS IS A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION.

MY LEFT HAND WAS RESTING ON THE STEERING WHELL AS I TURNED THE KEY. THE AIR BAG RIPPED MY WATCH FROM MY WRIST AND LACERATED THE WRIST IN NUMEROUS PLACES. MY NECK, CHEST AND BOTH ARMS WERE ABRAISED. VOLVO CARS OF NORTH AMERICA WAS NOTIFIED. THEY SENT A ""TECHNICAL SPECIALIST TO INSPECT THE CAR. VOLVO CARS OF NORTH AMERICA SENT ME A REPORT OF HIS FINDINGS WHICH STATED, ""OUR TECNHICAL SPECIALIST DID OBSERVE THAT THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDE FRONT FLOORING HAD SIGNS OF EXTENSIVE WATER DAMAGE AND THAT THE SRS SENSOR WAS HEAVILY CORRODED DUE TO THE EXPOSURE TO WATER. IT IS DUE TO CORROSION OF THE SENSOR THAT CAUSED THE AIRBAG TO DEPLOY."" I LIVE IN BUFFALO, NEW YORK. WE RECEIVE LARGE AMOUNTS OF SNOW IN THE WINTER. IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO HAVE WATER ACCUMULATE ON THE FRONT FLOORING. THE SENSOR IS LOCATED ON THE FLOOR UNDER THE DRIVER'S SEAT. ONE WOULD EXPECT THAT IT WOULD BE SUBJECTED TO THE ACCUMULATED WATER. THE QUESTION ARISES IN MY MIND WHY IS SUCH A CRITICAL SENSOR PLACED IN AN AREA THAT IS VULNERABLE TO WATER CORROSION? IT APPEARS TO ME TO BE A DESIGN ERROR. MY AUTO IS 13 YEARS OLD AND HAS OVER 200,000 MILES ON IT. MAYBE IT TAKES THAT LONG TO CORROD. THE POINT IS THAT IT DID BECAUSE IT WAS ON THE FLOOR WHERE WATER CAN SOAK THE CARPETING. I SHUTTER TO THINK WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE RESULT IF I WAS TRAVELING ON THE HIGHWAY AT 60 MILES PER HOUR WHEN IT DEPLOYED. ONE THING WOULD BE CERTAIN, I WOULDN'T BE WRITING THIS LETTER. I WOULD LIKE VOLVO TO REPLACE MY STEERING WHEEL WITH A NEW BAG AND A NEW SENSOR. I ALSO THINK THEY SHOULD CONSIDER PLACING THE SENSOR IN A MORE SECURE AREA.
