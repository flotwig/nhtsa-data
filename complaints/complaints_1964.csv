NONE OF THE OTHER TIRES HAVE THE SAME ISSUE AS THIS TIRE. THE TREAD PATTERN IS UNEVEN AND ODD SHAPED COMPARED TO ALL OF THE OTHER TREAD IN ONE SPOT AND THE TIRE IS UNBALANCED AND HAS SEVERAL BULGES IN IT. I HAVE CONTACTED THE COMPANY AND I AM GETTING THE RUN AROUND, THEY JUST FLAT OUT DON'T WANT TO ADMIT THAT THE TIRE IS MISMANUFACTURED. I DON'T BELIEVE IT IS AN EXPENSIVE TIRE, HOWEVER, I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE TIRE AND THE SAFETY OF ANYONE THAT MAY HAVE THEM. I DO BELIEVE THE TIRE MAY BE AN OLDER TIRE, BUT SINCE IT IS ON A SHOW CAR IS IS RARELY DRIVEN. WE CAUGHT THE DEFECT BEFORE THERE WAS A FAILURE, THANKFULLY.  I HAVE MANY PICTURES OF THE TIRE FROM ALL ANGLES SHOWING THE ISSUES. I SENT THEM TO THE COMPANY AS WELL.",FORD,FORD
