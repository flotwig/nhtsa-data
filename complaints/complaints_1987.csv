KNOWING A LITTLE ABOUT CARS I LIFTED THE HOOD TO CHECK THE TRANSMISSION FLUID. THE LEVEL WAS FINE BUT THE FLUID LOOKED A LITTLE DARK TO ME. I SMELLED THE FLUID AND IT SMELLED BURNT. THE TRANSMISSION HAD BEEN FINE UP TO THAT POINT SO I LOOKED AROUND TO SEE IF I COULD SEE ANYTHING ELSE WRONG. I NOTICED THAT THE TRANSMISSION CONTROL CABLE THAT ATTACHES TO THE THROTTLE WAS HANGING LOOSE. I TOOK OUT MY SHOP MANUAL AND COPIED THE PAGE WITH THE LINKAGE ON IT AND WENT TO A LINCOLN DEALER. I BOUGHT THE $1 PLASTIC PART THAT HOLDS THE LINKAGE ON AND RETURNED HOME. I REATTACHED THE LINKAGE AND HAPPILY DROVE OFF THINKING NO BIG DEAL. THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTED FINE FROM FIRST TO SECOND BUT WOULD NOT SHIFT INTO THIRD OR FOURTH. I CALLED A TRANSMISSION SHOP AND EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM. HE KNEW RIGHT AWAY WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND TOLD ME THAT MY TRANSMISSION WAS RUINED. HE EXPLAINED WHY AND I HAD NO DOUBT THAT HE WAS CORRECT. IT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME HE HAD SEEN THAT HAPPEN. I CONTACTED FORD BY EMAIL. THEY WOULD NOT HELP OUT IN ANY WAY AND SUGGESTED THAT I SHOULD HAVE SERVICED THE CAR REGULARLY AT A FORD/LINCOLN DEALERSHIP AND THAT THIS WOULD HELP TO PREVENT SUCH A PROBLEM. I WROTE BACK ASKING FOR THE NAME OF A MECHANIC THAT COULD PREDICT THAT TYPE OF PART FAILURE BY LOOKING AT IT AND I WOULD GO TO THAT PERSON. THEY SENT ME NO NAME. IF THIS TRANSMISSION FAILED DO TO ABUSE, LACK OF CARE, OR EVEN AGE, I WOULD NOT HAVE CONTACTED FORD OR NHSTA. IT FAILED BECAUSE FORD USED A PLASTIC PART THAT WOULD ALMOST SURELY BECOME BRITTLE AND BREAK WITH AGE. I SPENT $1400.00 TO GET IT REPAIRED BECAUSE FORD USED AN INEXPENSIVE PLASTIC PART TO HOLD LINKAGE TOGETHER ON AN EXPENSIVE TRANSMISSION. I WOULD HAVE CONTACTED YOU SOONER BUT WITH ALL THE TROUBLE FORD HAD WITH TIRE FAILURES I WANTED TO WAIT FOR THAT TO DIE DOWN. PLEASE HELP IF YOU CAN. THANKS, PAUL SCHRADIECK. *AK",LINCOLN,CONTINENTAL

THE FRONT WHEELS JUMPED THE TALL CURB AND PUSHED DOWN ONE OF THE PARTS OF THE TREE,  THEN WAS STOPPED IN PLACE BY THE HEAVY GRILL OF THE VOLVO SEDAN.  I EXITED THE CAR BEFORE IT JUMPED THE CURB,  THEN GOT BACK IN WHEN IT WAS BLOCKED BY THE VOLVO, AND TURNED OFF THE IGNITION.  AT THAT POINT THE CAR STOPPED AND THE WHEELS STOPPED SPINNING.   IT WAS AN EXCEEDINGLY DANGEROUS SITUATION, AND FURTHER DAMAGE WAS CONTAINED ONLY BECAUSE OF THE OBJECT IN FRONT OF THE CAR.   NO ONE WAS INJURED, AND THE ONLY DAMAGE WAS TO THE CAR FRONT AND  THE LANDSCAPING.  I SOLD THE CAR, SOON AFTER, BUT DID TELL THE BUYER ABOUT THE INCIDENT.   THIS WAS A TOYOTA CRESSIDA, APPROXIMATELY A 1987 YEAR MODEL.   CRESSIDA MODELS WERE DISCONTINUED,  BUT THEY ARE STILL BEING DRIVEN TODAY, AND SHOULD BE ON THE RECALL LIST!!!
