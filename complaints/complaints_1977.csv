ONE UNDULATION APPEARED ON THE SIDEWALL OF EACH TIRE 1-2 MONTHS AFTER INSTALLATION.  OVER TIME AN SECOND UNDULATION APPEARED ON THE REAR PASSENGER-SIDE TIRE. ADDITIONALLY, SINCE INSTALLATION, THE SIDEWALL OF EACH TIRE HAS HAD A ""RUSTY"" APPEARANCE.  WHILE THE SALESPERSON TOLD ME THAT THIS IS NORMAL, I LATER LEARNED THAT IT MAY BE A SIGN OF AGING RUBBER AND CORRODING STEEL CORDS. DUE TO SAFETY CONCERNS, I WOULD LIKE ALL FOUR TIRES REPLACED.  ALTHOUGH I HAVE EXPRESSED MY CONCERNS TO STORE MANAGEMENT ON THREE OCCASIONS BETWEEN 05/2006 AND 05/20/2007, THE ISSUE REMAINS UNRESOLVED.
