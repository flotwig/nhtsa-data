I HAD A LOCAL REPUTABLE SHOP INSTALL IT SAME TIME I RECEIVED IT. THE TIRE (235/70/15) HITS THE DRAGLINK AND THE TRUCK IS UNABLE TO TURN VERY SHARP TO THE LEFT. ON THE ROAD THE TRUCK IS MANUVERABLE LIKE MOST OTHERS. THE PROBLEM IS IN PARKING LOTS. NOW IT TAKES MANY BACK AND FORTH (JOCKEYING) MOTIONS TO GET IN OR OUT OF PARKING SPACES OR EVEN GETTING INTO THE LOT. I READ A RECENT ARTICLE IN ONE OF THE CLASSIC TRUCKS MAGAZINE FOR THE SAME POWER STEERING KIT FOR A FORD TRUCK, BUT IT HAS NO RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RIM OR TIRE SIZES. I CONTACTED CPP ABOUT THE PROBLEM, THEY HAVE NO FIX FOR IT AND RECOMMENDED A SMALLER RIM AND TIRE COMBINATION, BUT NOTHING SPECIFIC.  *TR",CHEVROLET,3100
