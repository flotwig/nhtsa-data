I WOULD STEP ON THE GAS AND THE VEHICLE HAD NO POWER. IT WOULD RESTART AND I COULD PROCEED. IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS AND SOMETIMES I WAS MAKING A LEFT TURN AND ONCOMING TRAFFIC WAS APPROACHING. THE VEHICLE WAS UNDER WARRANTY BY MERCEDES-BENZ AND I TOOK IT IN. THEY REPLACED THE INGNITION CONTROL MODULE AND OVERLOAD PROTECTION RELAY. IN JULY 2000, I HAD THE ENGINE SHUTTING DOWN AGAIN. IT WAS VERY INTERMITTEN BUT FINALLY I HAD IT TOWED TO THE DEALER IN NASHVILLE ON  AUGUST 7, 2000. IT WAS IN SEVERAL TIMES AS IT WAS HARD TO DUPLICATE TO PROBLEM. VARIOUS PARTS WERE CHANGED BUT THE INTERMITTEN PROBLEM CONTINUED.  WHEN IT WAS STILL CONTINUING IN SEPTEMBER I GOT ANOTHER APPOINTMENT AND HAD A FRIEND GO IN WITH ME. HE WATCHED THE INSTRUMENTS DURING THE FOUR TIMES IT STALLED AND NOTICED THAT THE TEMPATURE GUAGE WAS RISING WHEN IT SHUT DOWN. I HAD THE AIR CONDITIONING ON. I TURNED OFF THE AIR CONDITIONER AND IT DID NOT STALL DURING THE NEXT 25 MILES. I TURNED ON THE AIR AND WITHIN TWO BLOCKS THE CAR STALLED AGAIN. I PASSED THAT INFORMATION AND THE DEALER KEPT THE CAR FOR 3 DAYS. THEY REPLACED THE IGNITION CONTROL MODULE AND AT AN EARLIER APPOINTMENT REPLACED THE OVERLOAD PROTECTION RELAY. THEY TEST DROVE THE VEHICLE AND IT DID NOT FAIL AGAIN. I HAVE NOT HAD THE PROBLEM SINCE. I APPEARS THAT THE UNITS BREAK DOWN DURING HOT WEATHER WHEN THE AIR CONDITIONING IS ON. POSSIBILITY DUE TO INCREASED HEAT IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT . IT IS VERY DANGEROUS BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THAT YOU GET THE ENGINE RESTARTED WHILE DRIVING ON THE OPEN ROAD. COULD RESULT IN SERIOUS ACCIDENT. IN DECEMBER 2000, I WROTE MERCEDES-BENZ AND THEY  TOLD ME TO GO THRU THE  DEALER FOR ANY ASSISTANCE. THEIR  SERIAL NO. IS 107045-1A-008030.

RECENTLY, WHILE I WAS AWAY AT WORK, THE LEFT FRONT TIRE SUFFERED AND EXPLOSIVE FAILURE WHILE SITTING IN MY DRIVEWAY.  IT LOOKS LIKE A HIGH SPEED SEPARATION.  I EMAILED THE MANUFACTURER WITH PICTURES AND THE RESPONSE WAS A COPY OF THE WARRANTY INFORMATION (12 MONTHS).  MY MAIN CONCERN WAS THAT THE TIRE'S STEEL BELTS SEPARATED WHILE SITTING STILL.  IF IT HAD HAPPENED AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, ONE CAN IMAGINE THE RESULTS.   I IMMEDIATELY PURCHASED NEW TIRES, DIFFERENT BRAND, AND TOOK THEM TO MY MECHANIC FOR INSTALLATION.

NOTE: PRIOR TO GOING TO THE AUTO SHOP, MY CAR WAS IN TOP RUNNING CONDITION, EXCEPT FOR THE BRAKE PROBLEM.

THE FIRST PART OF MY COMPLAINT INVOLVES NON-SEALED BEAM HEADLAMPS.  SINCE ABOUT 1984, AUTOS HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO USE THIS TYPE OF HEAD LAMP, AND IT IS BECOMING  MORE AND MORE EVIDENT THAT THE PLASTIC USED FOR THE LENSES OF THESE HEADLAMPS DETERIORATES, EVENTUALLY MAKING THE LENS MORE AND MORE OPAQUE.  (I'VE NOTICED THIS ESPECIALLY ON VOLVO'S AND CHRYSLER MINIVANS MADE IN THE LATE 1980'S.)  THE FORMERLY USED SEALED BEAM HEADLAMPS WERE MADE OF GLASS AND SELDOM CLOUDED OVER.   ANY SAFETY ADVANTAGE OF CHANGING FROM GLASS TO PLASTIC CONSTRUCTION IS OVERRIDDEN BY THE LOSS OF VISIBILITY WITH CLOUDED LENSES.  IT WOULD BE SO GREAT IF SHATTER-PROOF GLASS SEALED BEAMS WOULD MAKE A COMEBACK!  THE SECOND PART OF MY COMPLAINT INVOLVES THE HID HIGH INTENSITY LIGHTS ON SOME NEWER CARS.  THEY ARE SO ANNOYING AND DISTRACTING TO ONCOMING TRAFFIC!  IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT BLUE LIGHTS WERE PERMITTED ONLY ON HIGHWAY VEHICLES LIKE SNOW PLOWS, BUT THESE CARS WITH THE BLINDING BLUE HEADLIGHTS ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE PREVALENT.   PERHAPS THEY DO IMPROVE FORWARD VISIBILITY FOR THE DRIVER, BUT THAT ONLY ENCOURAGES THE DRIVER TO GO FASTER.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THEY BE LIMITED TO FREEWAY OR HIGHWAY USE, IF AT ALL.  THANKS FOR LETTING ME VENT MY WRATH AT THE CURRENT STATE OF AUTO HEADLAMP DESIGN!  *JB",VOLVO,DL
