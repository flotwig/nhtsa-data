They did not reply.  But text a day after stating that we must have gone through a pothole at high speed or hit something,and we were liable for the cost.After my mother sent an email and spoke with them saying that if it was not caused by us,that if the issue was there,was it caused during transporting the car from The manufacturer to the dealer?they said that the car was fixed and there would be no charge but kept insisting that we were at fault,that it happens alot,where people walk out of the dealer and come back with something broken the next day.

It also renders the phone being charged inoperable due to overheating shutdown which is equally a safety hazard if there were to be a need to report an emergency. This condition has caused iphone device damage to the battery which could be a serious issue even outside the car after the phone has been removed from the charger pad. Stressing the battery pack over time could cause the phone to explode at any time. This includes public places or god forbid on an airplane.   This is a widely documented issue on AudiWorld forums and online. Other users have mentioned reporting this issue to NHTSA with variation of severity. I also read that this affects iPhones more than other brands devices due to the type of wireless charging iPhone devices use. Audi advertises the charger works with all wireless charging phones. Many wireless chargers exist that don’t cause this heat issue so it’s clearly an Audi hardware issue.  My particular experience, the charging pad caused my phone to overheat to the point where it shutdown and was no longer able to give me nav notifications or make phone calls. Upon touching the phone it was so hot it burned my hand which put myself and others on the road at risk. My partners iPhone was damaged and needed to be replaced by using this charging pad with a case on the phone which many people have. This is an expensive phone replacement with iPhones over $1000.   Any newer Audi with the phone charging pad package will repeat the issue with iPhones with wireless charging. I have tried and confirmed iPhone heating issue in 2 vehicles myself Many people have this experience per online forums. Many have gone to a dealer and it’s apparent it’s a known issue but refuse to provide a fix. There was no warning or indication of the issue from the Audi side of things.

The car was at rest, waiting for traffic light to turn green. Then the car started to move forward, and suddenly hit the car in front with a big thrust. My foot was on the brake trying to stop the car, but I felt like being hit by another car behind me, twice, the second time being the final thrust. My wife on the passenger side also felt the car shaking before the collision. Looking back after the collision, there was actually no car hitting mine. I believe the braking system failed. I have downloaded the video recordings from the car, with 30 seconds before and 30 seconds after the accident, by front, rear, left and right cameras, confirming that the car was at rest for about 20 seconds, then moving forward, and finally accelerating with a big thrust into the collision. I wish to have the Event Data Recorder (EDR) data to verify the pressure I applied on the brake pedal (or/and the pressure on the accelerator pedal as others may speculate that I did), to nail down the facts.  Two cars in front of mime were damaged, and one lady driver had injury. Luckily all cars were initially at rest. With higher speed and such brake failure it can cause deaths.  I have reported the problem to the BMW dealer in Rockville, Maryland. I will report to BMW manufacturer too. The dealer said BMW can send engineer to pull the EDR data and investigate. It will take time though.  I have reported the accident to insurance company. I'll talk with the insurance agent assigned to the case next Monday, to discuss what he wants to do for inspection.  In addition to the brake failure, there was no automatic emergency braking, or forward collision warning, as in my previous leased BMW car.

I took this to the dealer and was told this is normal. This cannot be normal, and it could easily cause a crash because the driver is probably not going to feel the vibration alert. I have posted about this on bimmerpost and others have complained of the same issue with their BMW M3 cars: [XXX]   Assuming this is normal as the dealer claims, or even if it's just a limited problem in some 2025 M3 cars, it is a safety issue because the point of the lane departure warning is to alert the driver that he is drifting into the next lane.

I am reaching out regarding ongoing issues with my 2025 BMW X7, which I purchased new. Shortly after purchase, I noticed that cavity fluid began leaking from all four doors and the tailgate. I contacted BMW, and they instructed me to take the vehicle to the service center at the dealership where I made the purchase.  The dealership kept the car for 10 days, and when I picked it up, I noticed that the cavity fluid had damaged the paint on the bottom of the doors. I immediately brought this to the service representative’s attention, and they asked me to leave the vehicle again, sending it to the body shop for repairs.  After 7 days, I collected the car, but unfortunately, within two weeks, the cavity fluid began leaking again in the same areas. I returned the vehicle to the service center for the third time, and as of today, it has been another 10 days without receiving the vehicle back.  Given the persistent nature of this issue, I contacted BMW to request a return of the vehicle and a refund, but I have not had any success with this request.

Had that classic “lifter tap” that eventually quieted down after 30-45 seconds but never fully went away.

Within three months of ownership, I have experienced three separate occurrences that have caused me significant concern and physical distress.    1    Approximately two weeks after purchasing the vehicle, I was stopped at a red light. When the light turned green, I pressed the Pedal. Within three- 4 seconds, I felt a sudden impact from the rear, as if I had been rear-ended. However, upon inspection, there was no visible damage to my car, and the vehicle behind me was approximately 10 feet away. This incident was both confusing and distressing.    2    On a separate occasion, under similar circumstances, I was stationary at a red light. Upon the light turning green, I began to accelerate and once again experienced a sudden, forceful jolt from the rear. No vehicle was in close proximity behind me, yet the sensation was akin to a severe rear-end collision. The jolt was significant enough to cause me considerable alarm.    3    The most recent and concerning event occurred on the evening of February 24, 2025, around 8:00 PM. I was reversing out of a parking spot at a supermarket. Within seconds of shifting into reverse and beginning to back up, I felt an intense impact, as though a vehicle traveling at high speed had collided with the rear of my car. The force was so substantial that I was convinced a serious accident had occurred. However, upon exiting the vehicle, I found no other cars in the vicinity and no visible damage to my vehicle.    Medical    Following these incidents, I began experiencing severe neck pain. The discomfort persisted and intensified over the course of a week. On the morning of February 25, 2025, I sought medical attention due to the escalating pain. At the hospital, XR cervical spine was performed, and I have been advised to pursue follow-up consultations with specialists.

The dash of the car has a slotted design unlike any I have seen in any other car, including other Chevy models currently available at Chevrolet dealerships. This slotted design creates numerous surfaces across the entire width of the dash that easily reflect the light thus producing a horrible glare on the windshield.  I first noticed this issue within minutes of my first test driving a '24 model back in May 2024, something the salesperson had claimed to be unaware of but quickly conceded it was bad. As we changed direction the problem subsided and he felt it was probably only a rare issue. I finally took delivery of a '25 model on 01/16/25 & discovered that the issue persists more frequently than expected & is bad enough to block a clear view of what is in front of the vehicle. The problem is worse during bright, sunny days & from certain angles to the sun, but I have also noticed it on cloud covered days as well. It has been suggested that I use polarized glasses to mitigate the issue, & they do help, but they create other issues such as clearly seeing controls inside the car or viewing the rearview mirror as they darken everything.  I am concerned that at some point, when the reflections are very bad, that I will not see a car backing out of a space in front of me or a pedestrian starting to walk out in front of me.

Occasionally this is with enough force that the signal will stay on, but it is usually only with force sufficient to tap the other signal and register only 2-3 blinks before stopping.  This is a safety issue because it looks like erratic signaling behavior to those outside of the vehicle. When travelling on busy highways at speeds exceeding 60mph erratic signaling of this kind can confuse other drivers and lead to collisions. It can make other drivers think you are driving erratically (like changing lanes only to double back into the lane you came from) or to try to pass you rapidly just to escape a driver that is signaling strangely.  This has been confirmed on many Equinox EVs, both '24 and '25 model years. This does not trigger any sort of errors, warnings, chimes or alerts. It simply excessively triggers the turn signals outside of when you would want them actuated. The fix is just to tweak the turn signal resistance to be more like other vehicles.

It only had 2200 miles on it when my transmission started slipping. I was really enjoying this SUV too. On January 13th I noticed something weird happening when I would accelerate.  When I would accelerate if felt like my tires were slipping on ice followed by a jerk. I knew it wasn't ice after accelerating at each stop.  This worried me because my 10 month old son was in the vehicle with me.  I was worried it was going to stop mid traffic. I drove it home and called the dealer and asked them to get me a loaner ASAP because the Traverse felt unsafe to drive. Luckily I got a loaner that same evening after dropping it off. When I returned home I saw the tranny leak on garage floor. A large reddish pink puddle. It's been in the shop since Monday. The Service department is trying to find parts to repair it. According to them they won't be available from GM until February 28th, unless they find it elsewhere. According to them it needs two bolts that are backing out of pump causing it to leak.  Cars been in the shop now 11 days and counting.  This is a big safety concern that needs to be made aware of to the public.

I was returning to Troy MI from Ann Arbor MI on [XXX] a roughly 50 mile drive, a driver with one passenger. The weather was good, no ice or debris on the roads. We exited the highway and proceeded north through several stoplights. Just before making a right turn into a destination, the vehicle seemed to slam to stop multiple times, causing loss of vehicle control. The abrupt behavior knocked the steering wheel out of driver hands and lurched us forward against the seatbelts. I parked and powered down, giving it a chance to reset. Then continuing to drive a short distance, the vehicle repeatedly abruptly halted at speeds over 30mph as if hitting a wall. There were no warning lights or alerts displayed on the instrument panel, and the vehicle had never behaved abnormally in any way prior to this incident. On Monday morning [XXX] the dealership immediately verified the condition, though offering no speculation to the cause. The service manager reported that upon test drive, the service tech said ""he would have gone through the windshield if not belted in.”  My passenger and I have between the two of us [XXX] years of experience working in automotive, for GM and suppliers, in production capacities, and for years driving dozens of leased vehicles and GM company cars. Neither of us have ever experienced a vehicle doing anything as dangerous as this brand new Trax did.

The vehicle, which has only 934 miles, has experienced a transmission failure. We picked the vehicle up on [XXX] and since February 27th, it has been at the dealership for repairs—now more than a full month. Initially, the torque converter was replaced, but that did not resolve the issue. After only a mile or two of driving, we returned the truck back to the dealer for further evaluation. Subsequently, after consulting with technical assistance, the dealership confirmed that the valve body needs replacement. As I'm sure you're well aware, this part is backordered nationwide, adding significant delays to an already troubling situation. It is hard to comprehend how a brand-new truck can fail virtually right off the assembly line. I am disappointed that we have had to deal with such a significant defect and even more disheartened by the extensive wait for repairs. This experience has left us questioning the safety and reliability of our vehicle. Given the circumstances, I believe more should be done to resolve this matter quickly and effectively for us. GM has been well aware of this transmission for years. The most recent recall dated December 13, 2024 for the same issue on the 2021 – 2022 model years of most of GM’s product line suggest this problem has not only been a known issue for many years but with the failure of my new vehicle for the same issue proves that they have not done anything about it. This leads me to believe that my safety is just as at risk as anybody else in the earlier named recall and therefore this recall should be extended to include all current models. GM should be forced to resolve this issue for existing vehicles before they build any new defective vehicles and sell them to unsuspecting customers like myself.

Why is this?    If the car is rated to have a 12.4 gallon tank, then I should be able to put in closer to 12.4 gallons.  Probably around 11 gallons because of the reserve.  What I think happened is that someone screwed up and put the 12.4 gallon fuel tank capacity from the non-hybrid version of this vehicle instead of the hybrid one, which for the sedan is 10.6 gallons.  Knowing this, I would never have purchased the vehicle.  This is false advertisement!  To the point, where I thought today I should have put more fuel into my vehicle even after the pump stopped because I should be near the 12.4 gallon capacity.  I believe this is a safety issue/concerns if someone thinks this as well.  So what do I do now in this situation?!  I thought I was purchasing a vehicle with a 12.4 gallon capacity and now I know it's false.  I have a screenshot of this, which is attached and also a screen recording also that I will be keeping for my records.  Thank you, [XXX] .

The first time this error appeared was when driving home from the lot after purchasing the vehicle (Bought at 56 miles). After the first appearance I've seen this error appear ~60% of the time when driving OR idle (these errors stay on then disappear within ~3 seconds of it appearing).   My vehicle was inspected by the purchase dealer's service personnel, but they claim that there is no error logs recorded on the car's s and they could not replicate the error.  At their direction I have since brought back the vehicle to monitor for the errors again so I can bring it back to the dealer for them to try to replicate this error again...  I am aware of the CMBS issue with Honda vehicles up to 2022. I am very sad and surprised that the 2025 vehicles also have this issue. I have not YET randomly braked on the freeway (thank god) but I am fearful that my vehicle is next because Honda says they cannot find an issue currently.  After noticing the frequent appearance of the warnings, I began documenting the warnings to the best of my ability with photos. To be safe I am unable to document the photo while driving so I am only able to take the pictures on the occasion when I am in the passenger seat when my wife is driving. I have attached two instances of when these errors pop up, one instance at 192 miles Parked, and one instance later driving at 35 MPH at 196 miles.   Unfortunately, due to my misplaced faith in Honda, I was unable to document the previous warnings, but I will try my best to safely document all future ones.

Picked it up on [XXX]. I found a safety issue where CarPlay is not playing audio output from any Maps (Apple/ Google/ Waze) if I’m in on a call. Apple designed the Apple Maps to chime if anyone is in a call while using CarPlay. I brought up this issue on 5/25 to the dealer but was told it’s an expected behavior.

The issue is consistent across 2023-2025 CRV Touring trim. I went back to EdVoylesHonda service on [XXX] and [XXX] only to be discredited on my findings, and the service manager said that it might be a compatibility issue with Bose speakers. It was deemed normal since all Gen 6 Touring has the same behavior. I was also told that the turn-by-turn also plays on the screen and should be keeping an eye on the screen instead.

Poor fuel mileage with a small fuel tank is dangerous on [xxx] in Kansas and Eastern Colorado.  This is due to the wide distances between fuel stops. There really is nothing out there due to lack of water.  If fuel was leaking, that is also a fire hazard.  Took to car to dealer for diagnosis.  No fault was found.

The only thing I can think is that it was due to a bicycle that was traveling the same direction at a slower speed than I was driving but I had plenty of room to go around and was not even close to hitting them.  The brakes were activated which was not only scary but dangerous.  Had a car been behind me there is a strong chance I would have been rear-ended because nobody in their right mind would expect me to hit my brakes in this situation. This prompted me to look at the manual where I saw Honda has a list of reasons the emergency braking could activate despite ""little chance of collision"".  The list is extensive with many reasons the system could activate incorrectly causing an accident, not preventing one. The unexpected braking itself is terrifying but how difficult Honda makes it to ""opt out"" of the system that obviously has many flaws is even more concerning.   I tried to turn off this system only to find out that it is a multi step process that can only be done when stopped so if you forget to turn it off you are stuck using it even if you don't trust the system.  Every other safety setting can be turned off while driving except this one.  Why make it so difficult for the driver to choose to have complete control of their car, especially when their system is admittedly flawed.  In addition, the emergency braking system is the only safety feature that resets every time you shut off the car.  So every single time you start the engine you have to go through multiple steps to choose to have control of your own vehicle.  It seems the system that is the most flawed is the only one Honda is trying to force drivers to use.  This is not safe for my family or those driving around me.

This has been well documented for years by owners across various mediums. The issue was not previously present (2017-2019) but appears to align with camera and/or software related changes. It remains unaddressed. I'm providing additional context below.  I just traded my 2017 Ridgeline RTL-E for a 2025 Black Edition. I never previously understood the complaints about the auto high beam, as my prior truck worked very well. I never had a ""false negative"" (failing to turn off for an oncoming car), ""false positives"" were always for reflective signs or similar directly in line of sight, and the response was virtually instantaneous (both on and off).  While I knew about the horrible post-2020 adjustment to only activate above 45 mph (the exact opposite use case for me, whereas I disengage on highway and engage on lower speed, unlit back roads), I was not expecting the dramatic decline in performance. It is now wholly unusable and unsafe, even when the speed criterion is met. The response is incredibly slow (5+ seconds when it turns back on at all), it frequently fails to turn off the high beams for approaching vehicles even on flat, straight roads, it constantly turns itself off for every minor light/reflection (and sometimes won't come back on for miles), etc. Beyond being an unusable advertised vehicle feature on higher trims, it presents an unacceptable safety risk for both the Ridgeline driver and other drivers on the road.

My concern is the the Auto High Beam Headlight feature.  This is one of the features for which I choice to purchase this particular pickup truck.  The issue/problem is as follows.  The auto high beam feature is very slow to respond and extremely inconsistent as to when and why the headlights switch from low beam to high beam and vice versa.  For example, I have experienced while driving a two lane very dark windy road with no street lights; the auto high beam feature is very slow to respond and once it does, it will switch very back to low beam if it detects reflections from traffic signs, reflectors in the center of the road, and or such things as porch lights.  I have witnessed the high beam feature switching to low beam when going up or down a hill in the road and/or while going around a corner with no on-coming cars.  This can be very unsafe because when you are depending on high beams to see around a corner and suddenly the bright lights switch to low beams is it extremely detracting and difficult to see around the corner when going the speed limit 55 miles per hour.  I have witness the high beam feature turning back on while approaching an on coming car and or being very slow switch to low beam while approaching an oncoming car.  I feel that this could be dangerous by blinding an on-coming driver.  One of the most important safety features on my new Honda Ridgeline is for all purposes unsafe and nu-usable.  I have not yet brought this to the dealer's attention because I suspect that they will tell me nothing can be done to fix these problems.  I however, intend to do so.

There are two primary issues:  1. Activation Speed and Sensitivity: The auto high beams only engage when the vehicle reaches speeds above 40 mph, which is higher than many competitors. Furthermore, the system frequently toggles between high and low beams, particularly when encountering yellow road signs, leading to potential distractions for the driver and reduced visibility in critical situations.  2. Inconsistent Performance: There are instances where the high beams fail to deactivate when approaching vehicles are detected, especially on curves. This inconsistency can create dangerous conditions by blinding other drivers, which is particularly concerning at night when visibility is crucial.  In contrast, my experience with the automatic high beams in a 2020 Honda CR-V has been flawless, highlighting a disparity in performance between models.  The Honda Ridgeline Owners Forum reflects widespread dissatisfaction with this feature, with numerous posts detailing similar grievances from other owners. Despite raising these concerns with a Toyota service dealer, I was met with indifference; the supervisor stated there was nothing they could do and suggested I report the issue instead.

Hyundai's integration of Forward Attention Warning (FAW) with the ACC prohibits the driver from using ACC while wearing sunglasses. If one is driving the vehicle with ACC engaged and puts on sunglasses, the FAW flashes a warning on the dashboard and disengages the ACC. In order to engage cruise control the driver must interact with the onboard video display system to switch from ACC to ""dumb cruise"". Obviously the driver's attention is distracted while manipulating the selection of cruise control. The driver is also forced to compromise driving safety because they are forced to choose between wearing sunglasses and being able to use ACC. Use of ACC enhances safety especially when driving into the sun or in low visibility situations. The incompatibility of ACC with sunglasses wear then compromises safety. To make matters worse the FAW options screen provides erroneous information. It indicates that the driver can turn off FAW, but turning it off does not in fact turn it off. Turning it off stops the FAW warnings only until the driver turns on and engages ACC at which time ACC apparently forces FAW back on and active. I took the problem to my local Hyundai dealer who confirmed the problem and indicated they could not repair the problem. Since I am considering a Georgia Lemon Law claim, I asked whether I needed to bring the car back since the lemon law gives the dealer/manufacturer 3 tries to fix the problem.

While loading my wife’s car I decided to start my bike and start getting a little heat in it before we left.  I approached the bike and pressed the power button, Ride command normally takes over 30 seconds to boot, so I stood there waiting for the screen. Once the screen booted I reach down with my foot and bring the shifter from first to neutral. This can be verified and validated by the audible click of the shifter as well as on the Ride Command screen. The “N” neutral light was clearly visible. The bike still on the stand I reach across the bike and hit the start button.   This is where things started to go from bad to worse. The engine turned over as the bike lurched forward (as if it was still in gear). At this point the engine actually started as the bike left the stand and fell onto its side as well as my legs. The bike was running at this point as it layed on its side for approx 3 seconds until the bike died and the hazards began to flash.   I swiftly checked the rear tire to ensure it was no longer turning and was able to get the bike uprighted within maybe 10 to 15 seconds of it laying over.   Once upright I validated again the bike was displaying neutral and it was. Damage was minimal when it went over there was contact from the left foot peg as well as the clutch lever (broke about two inches off the clutch lever). No other damage on the bike thank god. It only tweaked my back while trying to wrestle the bike as it moved uncontrollably.   This bike allowed two safety’s to be overridden, the neutral safety as well as the stand safety.

To avoid active traffic while allowing enough room for the automatic doors to open safely, I moved as close to the Kia Carnival as possible with my [XXX]  and infant in the stroller, engaging the safety breaks of the stroller. Due to the tight space, I underestimated the length the door needed to fully open by approximately 3 inches; this should not have been an issue as there is a sensor in the door that stops when it senses any object in its way. However, the sensor failed. The door did not stop when it came in to contact with the stroller that had my [XXX]  baby in it. With the safety brakes engaged to prevent the stroller from rolling away, I desperately tried to drag away the locked stroller as quickly as possible. The door hit the stroller, continuing to open regardless of the object (my infant in her stroller) in the way, hooking the stroller on the lip of the door and pushing it up and over. If I did not have my hand on the stroller and acted so quickly, my daughter could have been seriously injured or worse. If the stroller had been facing the other way, I fear what would have happened.  In addition, had it been my toddler standing there, she would have been crushed. I also endured bodily injury, physical strain, and mental anguish while keeping my children safe from this malfunction.  I was in shock by the pure fear created by that situation. It was devastating.   The door will not physically stop opening if you try to pull on it. The sensor does not work in detecting any body when opening.

No warning indicators or messages are displayed when this occurs. Turning the vehicle off and then on again temporarily resolves the issue.  One of the times it occurred, I went straight from a 25 mph city street onto a highway onramp that didn't have a safe place to pull off. When I got on the onramp, I discovered that the issue was happening as I was unable to accelerate beyond 30mph. The highway had a speed limit of 65mph and a minimum speed limit of 55mph. Joining the highway at 30mph was both illegal and unsafe and could have absolutely caused a fatal crash.  ---- To troubleshoot this issue, we took it into the dealership and they didn't find any errors recorded or anything abnormal in diagnostics. They told us it was probably just a malfunctioning of the ""Auto Highway Speed Change"" setting that is intended to slow you down around curves when using cruise control on the highway.  We told them that didn't make sense because it happened to us on city streets where that setting isn't even in play, but they insisted it was still the culprit and didn't investigate further.

The only thing that fixes the issue is literally pulling over and restarting the car, and then it drives fine. We took it into the dealer after the second incident and they claimed that a camera was just obstructed by ice, so the car probably thought it detected something in front of us so it stopped accelerating as a safety feature. To that, I said “but if the car thought there was something in front of us, it would have applied emergency braking, not just simply stopping any acceleration”… to which they replied “yeah I don’t know. Cars these days are just a giant rolling computer”.  The dealer just could not replicate the issue, so they had no way of really seeing or diagnosing it, which I understand but still frustrating.  They said they drove it 3 times but it didn’t happen. But again, it happens randomly (though cold weather seems to be a common factor).

When attempting to roll them down, all that can be heard is a clicking sound, and the windows do not move. This issue occurs randomly and without warning. The malfunction poses a safety concern, as functioning windows are necessary for proper ventilation, emergency egress, and communication with others outside the vehicle, including law enforcement or toll booth operators.  The issue was first reported to Kia of Bowie on December 9, 2024. However, the dealership stated they could not recreate the problem and, therefore, could not make repairs, citing that Kia would not reimburse them unless they could verify the defect. I was advised to record a video of the issue should it occur again. The problem has persisted multiple times, but due to being the driver, capturing a video was difficult. I was recently able to record the malfunction, showing both windows failing to operate with only the clicking sound audible.  On February 17, 2025, I returned to the dealership with a scheduled appointment to address this issue. After waiting 2.5 hours, I was informed that they again could not recreate the issue and that my video evidence was not considered sufficient for a repair. Despite following the dealership's instructions, no resolution has been provided.  Additionally, my Kia Connect system is not functioning properly, and the radio sound intermittently cuts in and out.

I immediately pulled over, and the vehicle was towed to a Kia dealership for inspection. After diagnosing the issue, the dealership claimed that small pebbles had damaged the radiator, leading to the coolant leak. They stated that this was considered an accident, not a defect, and therefore was not covered under warranty.  Why This is a Concern: After researching online, I discovered that many other Kia owners are experiencing the same issue, suggesting that the radiator may be vulnerable to road debris due to poor design or insufficient protection. A radiator should be durable enough to withstand normal highway driving conditions. A failure like this could cause engine overheating and sudden breakdowns, posing a serious safety risk to drivers and passengers.  Request for Investigation: Since this issue is affecting multiple Kia Sorento owners, I believe it should be investigated as a possible design flaw. If the radiator is too fragile to handle everyday road debris, Kia should issue a recall or Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) to address the defect and ensure driver safety.",KIA,SORENTO

Unfortunately, my experience has been nothing short of a nightmare.  In December 2024, just one month after purchase, the vehicle completely died while I was driving on the highway—a terrifying and unacceptable failure for a brand-new car. The vehicle was towed to the dealership, where it has remained ever since.  What has made this experience even worse is Range Rover’s appalling customer service. The company’s “repurchasing” agreement process, which I initiated nearly two months ago, is lengthy, convoluted, and appears designed to disadvantage the customer at every step. Despite repeated attempts to get answers, there has been no clear timeline for resolution, no updates from anyone with decision-making authority, and absolutely no way to escalate the matter to management.  For a vehicle in this price range, I expected premium customer care, but what I’ve received is the opposite: silence, frustration, and the sense that Range Rover cares more about protecting itself than making things right for its customers.

This car is the most expensive one Mazda sells and they exclude so many features from it that the Top trim inline 6 has. This is supposed to be the same car but hybrid. My chief complaints are deleting the lighting on the liftgate and not having the full lighting on the headlights. They are replaced with non functional dummy lights. That’s a safety hazard on such a large vehicle. Another feature I was unaware that I did not have was tilting side mirrors. Top trim of inline 6 has it. PHEV does not. Something is not adding up here and the amount of features missing on the top trim is aggravating especially when you consider the cost of the vehicles side by side and what you sacrifice to have PHEV vs inline 6. There are so many complaints about this car not having the same features as its gas counterpart. I took my car to the dealership on two separate occasions for these complaints because I thought they were defects. What also irritates me is that the PHEV is not even worth charging because you only get 27 miles of electric range. It does not last 27 miles though. I’m losing so many features because of these 27 miles and it’s unacceptable. Plus I have 2 recalls on the vehicle already and I can’t afford to trade it back in for the inline 6.,MAZDA,CX-70

I purchased the vehicle on February 15, 2025, and it currently has approximately 1,100 miles on it. Since acquiring the vehicle, I have experienced a persistent and extremely loud squeaking noise from the brakes, which occurs spontaneously. At times, the squeaking is so loud that pedestrians turn to look when I drive by.  In an effort to address this issue, I took the vehicle to Royal Palm Beach Mazda for inspection. The service department informed me that this is a known issue with this model and that Mazda has not yet identified a solution. They stated that there was nothing they could do at this time to fix the problem. Additionally, while I was at the dealership, I encountered another Mazda CX-90 owner who was experiencing the same issue.  Concerned about the safety of my vehicle, I reached out to Mazda Headquarters, but I was again told that there is not much that can be done. This response is deeply troubling. I purchased a brand-new vehicle expecting a reliable and safe driving experience. Now, I am left questioning whether my brakes are safe and whether this issue will worsen over time. I am particularly concerned about whether the brakes will function properly when I need to stop in an emergency.  Given that this appears to be a widespread issue affecting multiple vehicles, Mazda should take responsibility by either issuing a recall or offering to repurchase the vehicle. Driving a brand-new car with a potential brake defect is unacceptable and possibly dangerous.  I look forward to your prompt response and a satisfactory resolution to this matter.

This issue has to do with the  vehicle software calling for the camera system to calibrate itself each time it is driven.  The issue arises from the fact that the parameters needed to calibrate the camera system are not met as part of a normal driving pattern.  The vehicle needs to be driven in a straight line for approximately a quarter mile.  The process resets if the wheel is turned more than 10 degrees or the speed exceeds 18mph.  As a consequence the rear camera is stuck in and endless cycle of extending itself and retracting throughout a commute.  The constant noise coming from the rear of the car at irregular intervals distracts drivers and a passengers leading to dangerous driving conditions.  Furthermore attempting to complete the calibration process ie driving a quarter mile at a speed of less than 18mph puts the driver and others on the road in a dangerous condition that will likely lead to rear end collisions at some point.

This issue occurs only at night or in low-light conditions when the automatic anti-glare feature activates. When this feature turns on and a vehicle is behind me with its headlights on, the rearview mirror becomes foggy/cloudy, significantly obstructing my rear visibility.  This is a serious safety concern as it severely limits my ability to see vehicles, pedestrians, and objects behind me, especially during critical maneuvers such as lane changes, reversing, and merging onto highways. Rear visibility is crucial for safe driving at night, and this obstruction increases the risk of an accident.  I reported this issue to both Nissan Consumer Affairs and the dealership. They confirmed that this is the intended design of the rearview mirror. However, when I asked them about the technical benefit of this design, they were unable to provide a clear explanation as to why the mirror should become cloudy instead of properly dimming like standard auto-dimming mirrors.  Additionally, my side mirrors, which have the same automatic anti-glare feature, dim properly without becoming cloudy or obstructing my view. This inconsistency raises further concerns about the design or functionality of the rearview mirror.  The dealership and Nissan Consumer Affairs have inspected and acknowledged the issue, stating that the mirror is working as designed. However, I strongly believe that this design compromises safety.  There are no warning lights, error messages, or other indicators associated with this issue. The symptom appears only when the anti-glare feature activates at night, and the problem is consistently reproducible under these conditions.  I am requesting a formal investigation into this issue to determine if this design meets vehicle safety standards and to prevent potential hazards for other drivers.

The specific problems are as follows: Wiper Washer Malfunction: On the day of delivery, I discovered that the vehicle's wiper washer system was faulty. The washer fluid was frozen, making it unusable. Front Windshield Crack: On January 28, 2025, I noticed a curved crack approximately 7 to 8 inches long on the inside of the front windshield, directly in the driver's field of vision. This crack is clearly visible in sunlight, and when touching the interior side of the glass, it can be distinctly felt. At that time, the vehicle's mileage was 364 miles. After inspection, it was confirmed that the vehicle had not been involved in any collisions. I reported this issue to Nissan Sales on February 1, 2025. Nissan company conducted an inspection, confirmed the presence of the crack, and stated that the vehicle had not experienced any impact. However, nearly a month has passed, and Nissan has yet to provide a clear resolution. I am deeply concerned about whether this crack poses a safety risk while driving, particularly whether the windshield might shatter unexpectedly during operation. I do not know if this constitutes a serious safety hazard, nor can I determine whether the glass will suddenly break in the future. This uncertainty is causing me significant anxiety.

On February 1, I took the vehicle to a Nissan service center for inspection, and they confirmed the presence of another crack.  As a vehicle manufacturer, Nissan should have the professional equipment necessary to inspect the windshield for cracks. However, since I filed my complaint with Nissan on February 1, it has now been over 20 days, and I have yet to receive any resolution or formal response. I cannot help but wonder—is Nissan intentionally delaying this matter to avoid responsibility? If Nissan does not have the proper inspection equipment, I propose that the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles (NYSDMV) conduct an official inspection to determine the facts.  Additionally, on the morning after I picked up the car on January 11 I found that the windshield washer fluid was not spraying. Upon checking, I discovered that the washer fluid reservoir was completely frozen. When I reported this issue to the Nissan sales staff, I was told, “Nissan’s washer fluid is like this—it will work once the car warms up.” This response is unacceptable. Is this really the standard for delivering a new Nissan vehicle?  I am filing this complaint with DOT today because I am deeply concerned about the safety risks posed by the cracked windshield. In addition to the initial crack, I have now discovered another crack about 2 inches long near the first one. If this issue is not resolved promptly, it could pose a serious safety hazard. I urge DOT to take this matter seriously and push Nissan to take immediate action to address this issue and ensure consumer safety, preventing any potential accidents.

He called me later that evening and asked me to bring it in on Monday morning. I did not use the truck during the weekend because it felt very unsafe to drive. On Monday morning i drove it to the dealership and left it there. They did give me a loaner vehicle. 2 days later I got a call from Dave the service manager and he let me know that the ring that fell on my foot holds a brake pedal in place and that they were going to replace the entire brake pedal assembly, the abs module, the brake booster and some ecm (i didn't understand which one). This truck has been unusable now for 7 days and I've only owned it for 13 days. It's been in the shop for 5 days now.

Each time they say they cannot resolve. They say they have been in contact with the manufacturers “tech line” and have followed all their recommendations, but nothing has worked and there are no other resolutions available. There is nothing they can do. Due to the misfire code and the check engine light is on, the truck cannot be used safely on the road due to erratic performance.  Sometimes on the highway, maximum speed will drop to 40 mph.  Misfire codes also present a problem with potential engine damage.

My wife is a petite woman, about 93-97 pounds and 5 feet 4 inches tall. When she sits in the front passenger seat the airbag light stays in the ""airbag off"" position. She is not heavy enough to activate the ""airbag on"" light. The dealer inspected the passenger seat and said that the airbag on/off function is working properly and works as expected for persons about 100 pounds or more. They confirmed that the ""airbag on"" light does not come on for my wife. Your website indicates that you have used dummies for airbag deployment for children and small stature women. Is it safer for a small stature woman to have the airbag not deploy in a frontal collision than to deploy? We checked a 2025 Honda CR-V and the ""airbag on"" light is activated when she sits in the front passenger seat. We were given information that a weight of about 65 pounds is required to activate the airbag. Subaru has not told us what weight is required. It seems strange that the airbag activation requirements would vary from on vehicle to another. We are wondering whether it would be safer for us to keep the Subaru vehicle (where the airbag would not deploy) or replace it with the Honda CR-V, for which the airbag would deploy. Does your research indicate which option may be safer?. Subaru Customer Service said the airbag system is operating as it was intended and would not buy the car back.

Phantom emergency - braking at random, both low and high speeds. The most dangerous of the three. 2. Lane keep assist - unaware or unable to compensate for real driving conditions, construction areas, pedestrians walking a dog, heavy machinery on a semi-truck as examples. 3. Infotainment blinding - A large, HIGH GLOSS screen at a 45-degree angle, placing it in the direct reflective angle of three windows: Sunroof, passenger front, passenger rear. Absolutely blinding even with sunglasses on during the right time of day. The Sunroof can be pulled closed with a shade but the other two will still cause complete blinding.  How was your safety or the safety of others put at risk? 1. Emergency braking at slow speeds is annoying for sure, but it has also occurred at 65MPH and almost caused an accident had the nice lady behind not forced herself off the road to compensate. It braked for no reason (Rain? Splash? Not sure) and nearly caused an entire row of cars to crash into me.  2. Lane keep is highly problematic because it simply doesn’t know really what it’s doing or aware of surroundings. Per the above, examples had I NOT intervened: it would have happily crashed me into concrete following the wrong lines in construction areas, run a woman’s dog over as we tried to cross the lines to give passing space.  3.  The screen is set up so that it is directly in line to reflect the sun at different points in the day. When I say blinding, I mean REALLY blinding (It’s the SUN after all).

I was coming home at that time with the Tesla and about 100 yards from my house, I experienced a sudden acceleration with the car going from about 20mph to, I think, over 40 mph and crashed into the garage area of my house.  Around the time I started experiencing that unwanted acceleration, I heard a whining sound.  As it started that sudden acceleration, I checked below to make sure my right foot was pressing on the brake pedal and it was.  Since I have the regenerative braking with my tesla, the car should have decelerated but, instead, it sped up.  I continued to press the brake pedal but I could not mitigate my car’s continual acceleration.

To summarize the situation: I was given a car that is defective upon delivery on its most important core component for 2.5 months, when the car lacks even the basic legally required safety features, as well as premium features that I already paid off! During the process, I also spent a lot of time dealing with their customer service, and rescheduled appointments (I even had to drive to their service center several times to get a loaner and had to return the loaner early before they did not have parts to fix my car). Their negligence on safety, and promised features is simply astonishing and unacceptable. INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",TESLA,MODEL Y

However, upon using the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) VIN decoder, I discovered that the vehicle’s Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) indicates the vehicle’s trim level as Double Cab, which is incorrect. This discrepancy is a significant issue for the following reasons: Misrepresentation of Purchased Vehicle: The VIN incorrectly identifying the vehicle as a Double Cab misrepresents the actual 1794 Crewmax Edition I purchased. Potential Impact on Vehicle Value: This error may negatively affect the vehicle's resale value, as the documentation does not accurately reflect the vehicle's specifications.

I stopped my car just outside of the parking space and was turning left into the space. I lightly pressed the accelerator, as I have done hundreds of thousands of times since I started driving 57 years ago.  The car accelerated, leaping forward and revving so fast that the car drove over a concrete divide (about 5 inches above the ground and 2 feet wide), flattened a sign, and landed on two cars that were parked on the other side of the divide.   It was daylight and sunny.  There were no obstructions.",VOLVO,EX30

Our 2025 EKKO 23B was within the scope of NHTSA Safety Recall # 24V-541 (Winnebago # 186).  Winnebago did not offer to us a remedy -- other than to disable for an indeterminate length of time the solar charging system to which the recall applies -- within a reasonable time of their discovery and announcement of the recall.  Accordingly, we paid for a remedial installation that, in the opinion of the expert in solar charging systems who made the installation, rendered the previously unsafe system safe for use.  When Winnebago finally published its proposed remedy, we timely exercised our option to seek reimbursement for the work we'd already commissioned to have the problem cured.  Winnebago assigned ""case number"" 00* * * * 27 to our request.  On November 21, 2024, we submitted detailed information to Winnebago in support of our request.  On December 17, 2024, Winnebago's customer service representative informed us that Winnebago would not reimburse us for any part of the expenses we had incurred to cure the safety issues addressed in the this recall.  To the best of our knowledge, Winnebago denied our request without having physically inspected the replacement system that we installed.  We have attached to this complaint most of the documents that we provided to Winnebago by email and hard copy on 11/21/2024.  We believe that Winnebago is factually and legally obligated to reimburse us to the extent of our 11/21/2024 request.  We assert that Winnebago is not in compliance with its obligations to NHTSA and to us.  We object to Winnebago's denial of our request and respectfully suggest that the NHTSA open an investigation into the adequacy of Winnebago's obligations with respect to NHTSA Safety Recall # 24V-541 (Winnebago # 186).",WINNEBAGO,EKKO
