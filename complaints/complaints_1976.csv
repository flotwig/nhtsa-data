AFTER REGAINING COMPOSURE, I OPENED THE HOOD AND SAW THAT WHILE THE STEERING WHEEL TURNED THE ROD GOING INTO THE STEERING GEAR BOX, THE GEAR BOX DID NOT TURN THE WHEELS AT ALL.  I COULD TURN THE WHEEL LOCK TO LOCK WITH NO WHEEL MOVEMENT. A HALF MILE LATER I WOULD HAVE BEEN ON A FREEWAY WITH 65-70 MPH SPEEDS.
