WE PULLED OVER AND CHECKED THE ENGINE FOR FIRE AND HOT SPOTS AND DID NOT LOCATE ANY.  WE RETURNED TO DRIVING, THE VEHICLE CONTINUED TO SMELL OF SMOKE.  AS IT GOT WORSE, I SEARCHED THE VEHICLE FOR ANY ""HOT SPOTS"" AND FOUND THAT MY DAUGHTER'S JACKET, WHICH WAS LYING ON THE FLOOR BOARD, WAS ON FIRE.  THE CARPET AND INSULATION WAS COMPLETELY BURNED.  AS I PICKED UP THE JACKET, A HUGE GUST OF SMOKE WAS RELEASED AND MY HAND SLIGHTLY BURNED FROM THE JACKET.  MY HUSBAND IMMEDIATELY PULLED THE CAR OVER AND I OPENED THE DOOR TO THROW THE JACKET OUT OF THE CAR.  WE HAVE CONTACTED OUR INSURANCE COMPANY TO ASSESS HOW THE FIRE STARTED.  UNFORTUNATELY, WE ARE NOT AS COMFORTABLE AS DRIVING WHAT WE CONSIDERED OUR ""DREAM"" VEHICLE AND MY DAUGHTERS ARE AFFECTED BY THIS ORDEAL.  I AM ETERNALLY GRATEFUL THAT MY DAUGHTERS WERE NOT PHYSICALLY BURNED AS A RESULT.  I AM PERTURBED OF THE IDEA THAT HAD ONE OF MY GIRLS WOULD HAVE PLACED THEIR FOOT ON THE FLOORBOARD...  MY ONLY OTHER THOUGHT HAS BEEN THE OTHER KIDS RIDING IN THE BACK OF A 1966 CADILLAC AND THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS THAT COULD OCCUR.  *LA",CADILLAC,CADILLAC
