This constitutes a safety hazard.  This is a well known issue with Honda as I discovered when researching the matter online after the vehicle purchase.,HONDA,PASSPORT

I was able to re-start the vehicle and it operated as usual.    We have an appointment scheduled with our local Honda dealership on 05/19/25 to inspect the vehicle.",HONDA,PASSPORT

The small screen on the gauge cluster shows incorrect street names that are nowhere near your location, and also tells you incorrect turns. For example, the large navigation screen on the infotainment system will say to make a right turn on the correct street, while the small screen on the gauge cluster will tell the driver to make a left turn an a different street that that the vehicle is not near. Sometimes it will make up random street names. This is dangerous to drivers who are not aware of the problem or forget about it because it causes confusion while driving. This causes the driver to wonder which set of directions to follow, make wrong turns, and look for streets that are not there. This would be especially dangerous to new drivers or elderly drivers.   The vehicle was taken to 2 different dealerships for service but neither one of them were able to fix the problem. The dealerships have acknowledged the problem.   There are no warnings or messages about the problem.   The vehicle is available for inspection and the problem can be easily reproduced 100% of the time.",HONDA,PASSPORT

The Tesla failed to initiate Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) and no airbags deployed.  This raises serious concerns about the functionality of Teslaâ€™s safety systems in real-world scenarios.  The vehicle has not been modified in any way and was in standard driving mode. I have contacted Tesla Support requesting a diagnostic and explanation, but I believe this incident should also be reviewed as a potential safety defect.",TESLA,MODEL Y

When at the traffic light to turn left onto the highway my car suddenly did a 90 degree turn and entered the highway on the completely wrong side, directly into oncoming traffic. This happened this morning at approximately 450-500am PST.  It turned and made such a sharp left that I had to grab the wheel and take over. But it was too late, it was already on the WRONG SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY heading directly into oncoming head on traffic... It happened so fast that I hit the button somehow and canceled the ability to submit my report on why I took over.   This happened heading south on [XXX] in Brentwood CA. It turned left onto the wrong side of [XXX].  My car has never had any issued like this until this morning. This is so bad that I am now scared to even drive the car.   I am hoping you might still be able to access the drive and see what happened.
