11654960,Honda (American Honda Motor Co.),0,0,0,0,04/15/2025,04/16/2025,5FNYF9H32TB,EXTERIOR LIGHTING,The LED headlights are so dim that when other cars with normal LED headlights pass you on the left or on the right it appears as though the headlights on the 2026 Passport are not even turned on.  This constitutes a safety hazard.  This is a well known issue with Honda as I discovered when researching the matter online after the vehicle purchase.,HONDA,PASSPORT
11658970,"Tesla, Inc.",1,0,0,0,05/05/2025,05/05/2025,7SAYGDEE4TA,"AIR BAGS,SERVICE BRAKES,FORWARD COLLISION AVOIDANCE","I was driving my 2026 Tesla Model Y when another vehicle pulled out from a driveway and struck the front/side of my car. The Tesla failed to initiate Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) and no airbags deployed.  This raises serious concerns about the functionality of Teslaâ€™s safety systems in real-world scenarios.  The vehicle has not been modified in any way and was in standard driving mode. I have contacted Tesla Support requesting a diagnostic and explanation, but I believe this incident should also be reviewed as a potential safety defect.",TESLA,MODEL Y
