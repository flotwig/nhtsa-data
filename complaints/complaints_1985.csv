WHILE ATEMPTING TO PULL INTO TRAFFIC MY VEHICLE COMPLETELY DIED AS IF I HAD TURNED OFF THE KEY. LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO COAST TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND JUST BARELY AVOIDED BEING HIT. THE CAR WOULD NOT RESTART UNLESS I JIGGLED THE KEY. I CALLED A FORD DEALER AND THEY SAID MY CAR WAS NOT COVERED UNDER THE RECALL BUT THE TOLD ME HOW TO FIX THE PROBLEM. I REPLACED THE SWITCH AND THE CAR IS RUNNING FINE NOW. HOWEVER IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO REMOVE THE SWITCH DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT HAD MELTED TO THE WIRING HARNESS. I STILL HAVE THE PART IN MY POSSESSION. MY OTHER COMPLAINT IS REGARDING THE STATOR PICK-UP ASSEMBLY UNDER THE BASE OF THE DISTRIBUTOR CAP. NOT ONCE BUT TWICE I HAVE HAD TO REPLACE THIS ASSEMBLY DUE THE FACT THAT IT HAD MELTED AND FELL APART. IN THIS INSTANCE MY FAMILY WAS WITH ME AT A VERY DANGEROUS INTERSECTION WHERE IT TOOK ME ROUGHLY 20 MINUTES TO GET THE CAR TO REFIRE ENOUGH TO MOVE IT OUT OF HARMS WAY. ALL THE CAR WOULD DO IS START UP RUN ENOUGH TO ROLL IT A LITTLE MORE FORWARD. I ATTEMPTED TO PUSH THE CAR BUT BECAUSE OF THE TRAFFIC I GAVE UP RATHER THAN BEING STRUCK BY ANOTHER VEHICLE. AGAIN I CALLED FORD AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT MY CAR WAS NOT COVERED UNDER THE RECALL FOR THIS PARTICULAR PART. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS IF THERE IS SOME ORGANIZATION THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP ME OR PERHAPS YOU COULD PROVIDE ME WITH INFORMATION AS TO WHAT LEGAL GROUP I MIGHT BE ABLE TO CONTACT.*AK,FORD,THUNDERBIRD

SEVERAL MACHANICS MADE STATEMENTS THEA THEY HAD NEVER KNOWN OF AN INTAKE MANIFOLD TO EXPLODE. THIS IS WHEN I STARTED TO THINK ABOUT THINGS THAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE PAST. ONCE THE MECHANIC HAD REMOVED THIS UNIT HE MENTIONED THAT THIS UNIT HAD MANY DEFECTS IN IT.  THERE WERE THIN SPOTS AND THICK SPOTS THAT VARIED THROUGH OUT THIS UNIT. ONE BEING WHERE THIS UNIT HAD EXPLODED, LEAVING A HOLE IN IT THE SIZE OF A BULLET, YET IT WASN'T A BULLET HOLE. AFTER DRIVING MY CAR HOME I IMMEDIATELY REALIZED THAT THIS CAR WAS DRING BETTER THAN IT EVER HAD WITH OUT THE HESITATIONS.  I THEN REALIZED THAT THIS DEFECT COULD HAVE BEEN EFFECTING THE OPERATION OF THIS CAR FROM DAY ONE.  ONE DEALER'S SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME THAT THE PARTS WERE OBSOLETE, THEREFORE I WOULD HAVE TO SCRAP IT.  ONCE I FOUND MANY PARTS ON THE INTERNET I KNEW THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG. THIS PARTICULAR PART SELDOM WORE OUT UNLESS IT WAS FACTORY DEFECTIVE, I FELT BETTER.  NOT BECAUSE OF THE DEFECT ITSELF, BUT TO KNOW THAT MY COMPLAINT FOR ALL THESE YEARS HAD NOT BEEN A FIGMENT OF MY IMAGINATION, JUSTIFIED MY COMPLAINTS TO THE MANUFACTURER. I KNOW THE CAR IS OLD AS I HAVE BEEN REMINDED OF MORE TIMES THAN I CARE TO MENTION.  MUST KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER CONSUMERS THAT WENT THROUGH THIS SAME ORDEAL.

WHEN I CONTACTED MY LOCAL PONTIAC DEALER THEY HELPED ME VERY LITTLE & INSISTED THAT I MAKE 700.00 WORTH OF REPAIRS MYSELF TO CORRECT IT. DISCOURAGED & UPSET I TRIED TO CONTACT GENERAL MOTORS MYSELF DIRECT. GENERAL MOTORS WILL NOT EVEN ADMIT THAT THERE HAS EVER BEEN ANY KIND OF RECALL ON THIS VEHICLE & HAS DONE ABSOLUTLY NOTHING TO HELP ME OR RECTIFY THE PROBLEM. (MY COMPLAINT / CASE NUMBER WITH GM IS #99027524) ON 12/31/98 WHILE TRAVELING OUT OF TOWN TO VISIT RELATIVES THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT OF THE CAR FILLED WITH SMOKE & EXHAUST FUMES & AT THAT POINT I THOUGHT THE ENGINE WAS ON FIRE. AFTER PULLING OVER & MAKING AN EMERGENCY STOP I WAS TOLD THAT IT JUST MAY HAVE BURNED THROUGH & WAS NOT ON FIRE. ALL I WANT IS SOME HELP FROM THE MANUFACTURER TO RECTIFY THIS PROBLEM. TO DATE MY COMPLAINTS GO UN-ANSWERED. I AM NOW DEALING WITH CONSTANT EXHAUST FUMES ENTERING THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT & MAKING MYSELF & PASSENGERS SICK TO OUR STOMACHES WITH THE CONSTANT CARBON MONOXIDE SMELL & YET FACE THE RISK OF A POSSIBLE FIRE. I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY HELP THAT YOU PEOPLE MAY BE ABLE TO GIVE ME IN GETTING THIS SITUATION SETTLED WITH THE MANUFACTURER.

WHILE SHE WAS INSIDE,I LET THE CAR IDLE. WITHIN 3 MINUTES, THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT WAS ON FIRE. NO WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON AND THE MOTOR NEVER GAVE ANY INDICATION OF A PROBLEM. THE PEOPLE IN THE PARKING LOT TOLD ME TO GET OUT OF THE CAR ,IT WAS ON FIRE, I CUT OFF THE CAR , POPPED THE HOOD AND THEN STARTED TO OPEN THE HOOD BUT THE SMOKE WAS SO THICK, DARK TAN AND PEPPERED WITH BLACK, THAT I COULDN'T GET CLOSE. THE STORE EMPLOYEES CALLED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, THEY CAME AND PUT OUT THE FIRE. THE WIRING, PLASTIC CONTAINERS,HOSES, INSULATION, ETC. WERE BURNT TO A CRISP. WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT CAUSED THE FIRE, I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED!",VOLVO,740
