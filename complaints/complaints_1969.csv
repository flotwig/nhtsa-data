ISSUE 1 RELATES TO FORD PART NUMBER C9AF-9510-U CARBURETOR (MFR IS HOLLEY). I PURCHASED A REBUILD KIT FROM HOLLEY AND IT WAS SUPPLIED WITH A NEW ACCELERATOR PUMP DIAPHRAGM. THIS DIAPHRAGM IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH GASOLINE BEING SOLD TODAY. THE NEW DIAPHRAGM FAILED WITHIN 3 WEEKS DUE TO THE CHEMICAL ATTACK OF THE ETHANOL IN TODAY'S FUEL. YOU CAN NOW SEE LIGHT THROUGH THE NEW DIAPHRAGM.    ISSUE 2: HOLLEY ALSO SELLS A FUEL PRESSURE REGULATOR # 12-803BP. I HAVE HAD TO REPLACE 3 DIAPRAGHMS IN UNDER A YEAR. THE LAST DIAPHRAGM LASTED 3 WEEKS AND NEARLY BURNED MY CLASSIC 1969 MUSTANG. THE ETHANOL IN THE FUEL IS SO AGGRESSIVE THAT IN THAT 3 WEEK PERIOD IT COMPLEATELY ATE THROUGH THE DIAPHRAGM AND YOU CAN NOW SEE LIGHT THROUGH IT. THIS COMPONENET IS UNDER HIGH PRESSURE AND FUEL CAN AND DOES SPRAY OUT OF THE REGULATOR.    I REQUEST THAT THE COMPANY BE ISSUED A CEASE AND DESIST ORDER FROM SELLING PARTS THAT ARE LABELED AS BEING COMPATIBLE WITH GASOLINE, WHEN IN FACT, THE COMPONENETS PRESENT A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER TO PUBLIC SAFETY FROM A FUEL SPILL AND LEAK THAT COULD RESULT IN FIRE, DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY AND LOSS OF LIFE.
